north_star:
  statement: "Develop design maturity through structural thinking, not material imitation."
  primary_user_job: "Create poster/graphic designs that communicate ideas structurally within tooling constraints."
  tone: "Honest critique, strategic constraint acceptance, conceptual density over decoration"

laws:
  - id: law.constraints.accept
    rule: "Design within tooling strengths, not around weaknesses. Pencil/.pen excels at: grid logic, scale contrast, modular color systems, asymmetry, typography hierarchy, nested frame depth, flexbox layouts."
    strength: hard
    applies_to: [design, technical]
    rationale: "V4 breakthrough came from accepting constraints, not fighting them."
    provenance: [session_20260221]
    last_verified: "2026-02-21"

  - id: law.material.abstraction
    rule: "Never simulate materials literally. Abstract the IDEA structurally: glass = typographic scale recession; gloss = offset vector shadow; emboss = high-contrast stroke/fill; texture = dot density variation."
    strength: hard
    applies_to: [design, concept]
    rationale: "Conceptual translation beats failed imitation. Material simulation hits ceiling; structural abstraction scales."
    provenance: [session_20260221]

  - id: law.hierarchy.first
    rule: "Establish hierarchy before decoration. Every design needs one dominant visual thesis - identify and commit to it before adding secondary elements."
    strength: hard
    applies_to: [design, composition]
    rationale: "Designs without clear hierarchy feel indecisive regardless of execution quality."
    provenance: [session_20260221]

  - id: law.flexbox.respect
    rule: "Work WITH flexbox, not against it. Use layout: vertical/horizontal, fill_container, nested frames with padding/gap. Absolute x/y positioning inside flexbox parents will be ignored."
    strength: hard
    applies_to: [technical]
    rationale: "Technical constraint - fighting this wastes iterations."
    provenance: [session_20260221]

  - id: law.symmetry.justify
    rule: "Avoid safe symmetry unless structurally justified. Asymmetry creates tension and visual interest."
    strength: soft
    applies_to: [design, composition]
    rationale: "Symmetry is the default safe choice; asymmetry requires intentionality."
    provenance: [session_20260221]

  - id: law.typography.mechanism
    rule: "Typography can serve multiple roles: structure + content + texture. Exploit scale contrast, weight variation, and stacking for depth."
    strength: soft
    applies_to: [design, typography]
    rationale: "Typography is the most controllable element in the system."
    provenance: [session_20260221]

  - id: law.negative.space
    rule: "Negative space is not empty - it's structure. Consider making it the dominant form."
    strength: soft
    applies_to: [design, composition]
    rationale: "P07's 'GRID' in white space demonstrated structural irony through negative space."
    provenance: [session_20260221]

constraints:
  do_not:
    - "Attempt blur, refraction, or optical effects - tooling doesn't support them"
    - "Use rgba gradients - they often render as blank/white"
    - "Fight absolute positioning inside flexbox - restructure instead"
    - "Create 'branding splashes' when systematic design is appropriate"
    - "Copy shapes without understanding the underlying design logic"
  tooling_strengths:
    - "Grid logic and modular systems"
    - "Scale contrast (typographic and elemental)"
    - "Color blocking and modular color systems"
    - "Asymmetric layouts and tension"
    - "Typography hierarchy and weight variation"
    - "Nested frame depth (structural 3D)"
    - "Flexbox layouts with fill_container"
  tooling_weaknesses:
    - "Optical realism and material simulation"
    - "Blur, glass morphism, refraction"
    - "Texture integration and grain"
    - "Shadow nuance and soft shadows"
    - "Absolute positioning inside flexbox"
    - "Complex gradient fills"

patterns_top:
  - id: pattern.depth.nested
    pattern: "Nest frames inside frames with padding. Each layer = different shade. Asymmetric corner radius adds tension."
    when: "Creating depth/3D effect"
    value: "Structural depth without fake physics. See P02v4."

  - id: pattern.depth.typographic
    pattern: "Stack same word at decreasing sizes with color gradation (dark to light = receding). Use thin weights for atmosphere."
    when: "Creating recession/transparency effect"
    value: "Pseudo-transparency through scale. See P03v4, P09v4."

  - id: pattern.shadow.offset
    pattern: "Two text layers: shadow (darker, offset +16px x/y) behind main (bright color). Single word, massive scale."
    when: "Creating glossy/dimensional type"
    value: "Vector shadow creates dimension without blur. See P08v4."

  - id: pattern.grid.modular
    pattern: "Varying column widths per row. Place typography in negative space (structural irony). Bold color blocks."
    when: "Creating editorial/magazine layouts"
    value: "Rhythm through proportion shifts. See P06v4, P07v4."

  - id: pattern.specimen.sheet
    pattern: "Anatomy markers (cap height, x-height, baseline as colored lines), metrics section (ratios as data), weight samples grid."
    when: "Typographic poster design"
    value: "Intelligence layered onto composition. See P01v4."

  - id: pattern.texture.halftone
    pattern: "Dot grid with varying sizes (density variation). Add print metadata (LPI, angle) for credibility."
    when: "Creating texture without images"
    value: "Structural texture abstraction. See P04v4."

  - id: pattern.pencil.batch
    pattern: "Use 20-25 operations per batch_design call. Too small = slow; too large = error-prone. Group related operations together."
    when: "Executing Pencil MCP batch operations"
    value: "Efficiency sweet spot for reliable design iteration."

  - id: pattern.pencil.layout
    pattern: "Build layout from outside-in: frame → padding → children. Use fill_container for responsive widths, explicit height only when needed."
    when: "Creating layouts in Pencil"
    value: "Prevents layout collapse and unexpected clipping."

  - id: pattern.pencil.gradients
    pattern: "Prefer solid colors over gradients. When gradients needed, use linear with defined stops. Avoid rgba - renders as white."
    when: "Applying fills in Pencil"
    value: "Prevents blank/white rendering bugs."

  - id: pattern.poster.priorities
    pattern: "Typography as hero (bold type, scale contrast). Bold color blocking (3-4 color max). Asymmetric layouts. Grid-based but broken deliberately."
    when: "Designing posters/graphics"
    value: "Poster format hierarchy based on tournament results."

workflows:
  - id: workflow.tournament
    name: "Design Tournament"
    steps:
      - "Phase 1: Moodboard scan (10+ references, extract patterns)"
      - "Phase 2: Rapid exploration (4-6 variations, 15 min max each)"
      - "Phase 3: Tournament bracket (head-to-head comparisons)"
      - "Phase 4: Winner refinement (polish top 1-2 only)"
    rationale: "Prevents premature commitment. Comparison reveals quality better than isolation."

  - id: workflow.moodboard
    name: "Moodboard to Mockup"
    steps:
      - "Collect references (diverse sources, not just direct competitors)"
      - "Extract atomic patterns (colors, type treatments, spacing)"
      - "Identify structural principles (not surface aesthetics)"
      - "Translate principles to tooling constraints"
    rationale: "Copying shapes fails; translating principles succeeds."

  dark_ui:
    when: "Pro tools, creative apps, data-heavy interfaces, premium positioning"
    avoid_for: "Consumer apps, accessibility-critical contexts, content-heavy reading"
