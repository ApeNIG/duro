north_star:
  statement: "Develop design maturity through structural thinking, not material imitation."
  primary_user_job: "Create poster/graphic designs that communicate ideas structurally within tooling constraints."
  tone: "Honest critique, strategic constraint acceptance, conceptual density over decoration"

laws:
  - id: law.constraints.accept
    rule: "Design within tooling strengths, not around weaknesses. Pencil/.pen excels at: grid logic, scale contrast, modular color systems, asymmetry, typography hierarchy, nested frame depth, flexbox layouts."
    strength: hard
    applies_to: [design, technical]
    rationale: "V4 breakthrough came from accepting constraints, not fighting them."
    provenance: [session_20260221]
    last_verified: "2026-02-21"

  - id: law.material.abstraction
    rule: "Never simulate materials literally. Abstract the IDEA structurally: glass = typographic scale recession; gloss = offset vector shadow; emboss = high-contrast stroke/fill; texture = dot density variation."
    strength: hard
    applies_to: [design, concept]
    rationale: "Conceptual translation beats failed imitation. Material simulation hits ceiling; structural abstraction scales."
    provenance: [session_20260221]

  - id: law.hierarchy.first
    rule: "Establish hierarchy before decoration. Every design needs one dominant visual thesis - identify and commit to it before adding secondary elements."
    strength: hard
    applies_to: [design, composition]
    rationale: "Designs without clear hierarchy feel indecisive regardless of execution quality."
    provenance: [session_20260221]

  - id: law.flexbox.respect
    rule: "Work WITH flexbox, not against it. Use layout: vertical/horizontal, fill_container, nested frames with padding/gap. Absolute x/y positioning inside flexbox parents will be ignored."
    strength: hard
    applies_to: [technical]
    rationale: "Technical constraint - fighting this wastes iterations."
    provenance: [session_20260221]

  - id: law.symmetry.justify
    rule: "Avoid safe symmetry unless structurally justified. Asymmetry creates tension and visual interest."
    strength: soft
    applies_to: [design, composition]
    rationale: "Symmetry is the default safe choice; asymmetry requires intentionality."
    provenance: [session_20260221]

  - id: law.typography.mechanism
    rule: "Typography can serve multiple roles: structure + content + texture. Exploit scale contrast, weight variation, and stacking for depth."
    strength: soft
    applies_to: [design, typography]
    rationale: "Typography is the most controllable element in the system."
    provenance: [session_20260221]

  - id: law.negative.space
    rule: "Negative space is not empty - it's structure. Consider making it the dominant form."
    strength: soft
    applies_to: [design, composition]
    rationale: "P07's 'GRID' in white space demonstrated structural irony through negative space."
    provenance: [session_20260221]

  - id: law.withholding
    rule: "Withhold explanation. Let tension exist without resolution. Labels like 'VS', 'ORDER', 'CHAOS' weaken the argument. The design should create cognitive friction that the viewer must resolve."
    strength: soft
    applies_to: [design, concept]
    rationale: "V6 proved that withholding is power. P09 Withheld (9/10) had no explanation - just suspended tension."
    provenance: [session_20260221_v6]
    last_verified: "2026-02-21"

  - id: law.palette.variation
    rule: "Vary visual vocabulary across batches. Avoid house style crutches (e.g., black background + pink accent). Instability should manifest in structure, not just palette."
    strength: soft
    applies_to: [design, composition]
    rationale: "V6 risk identified: aesthetic flattening. Structure should carry the concept, not color habit."
    provenance: [session_20260221_v6]

  - id: law.contradiction.trifecta
    rule: "Aim for the contradiction trifecta: (1) Structural - order disguised as chaos or vice versa, (2) Semantic - meaning vs form in conflict, (3) Perceptual - what eye believes vs what measurement proves."
    strength: soft
    applies_to: [design, philosophy]
    rationale: "V7 achieved all three. This trifecta is rare and creates genuine cognitive dissonance."
    provenance: [session_20260221_v7]
    last_verified: "2026-02-22"

  - id: law.deception.quiet
    rule: "Advanced work whispers contradiction rather than declaring it. Avoid obvious irony, semantic jokes, or overt dissonance. Design should feel honest at first glance and only reveal deception through interaction or measurement."
    strength: soft
    applies_to: [design, philosophy]
    rationale: "V7 declared 'perception lies.' V8 must whisper it. Whispering is more dangerous than shouting."
    provenance: [session_20260221_v7]

  - id: law.tolerance.design
    rule: "Design tolerances, not ideas. Use sub-perceptual anomalies: 1-2px off-center, 99% scale, 0.1px weight differences, √2 ratios, prime-number spacing. The anomaly must be measurable but not consciously detectable."
    strength: soft
    applies_to: [design, calibration]
    rationale: "V8 shifted power from concept to calibration. P04 Perfect Grid (9.2) proved boring-looking grids with irrational ratios create unease without revealing why."
    provenance: [session_20260222_v8]
    last_verified: "2026-02-22"

constraints:

    - "Copy shapes without understanding the underlying design logic"
    - "Add thesis labels ('VS', 'ORDER', 'CHAOS') - let the design argue without explanation"
    - "Rely on single palette (black + pink) across batches - vary vocabulary"
    - "Make contradiction formulaic ('word means X, design shows opposite') - viewer expects the trick"
    - "Announce deception - whisper it instead, let it be discovered"
    - "Use labels that frame interpretation (CENTER, PERFECT, EVEN) when pursuing true silent deception - labels hint at theme even without jokes"

    steps:
      - "Phase 1: Moodboard scan (10+ references, extract patterns)"
      - "Phase 2: Rapid exploration (4-6 variations, 15 min max each)"
      - "Phase 3: Tournament bracket (head-to-head comparisons)"
      - "Phase 4: Winner refinement (polish top 1-2 only)"
    rationale: "Prevents premature commitment. Comparison reveals quality better than isolation."

  v3: "Fighting physics - ceiling hit (6.7/10)"
  v4: "Designing within constraints - structural maturity (7.75/10)"
  v5: "Testing design philosophy - conceptual maturity (8.4/10). Posters became visual propositions. Top: P04 Negative Dominant (9), P06 Scale Reading (9)."
  v6: "Controlled instability - psychological maturity (8.65/10). Creates unease without chaos. Top: P03 Almost Gone (9), P06 Strained (9), P09 Withheld (9). Key insight: V5 proved system can think. V6 proved it can withhold. Withholding is power."
  v6_risk: "Aesthetic flattening - black + pink accent becoming house style crutch. Instability should manifest in structure, not just palette."
  v7: "Perceptual philosophy - epistemological maturity (8.95/10). Achieved the trifecta: structural contradiction (order disguised as chaos), semantic contradiction (meaning vs form), perceptual contradiction (absence vs density). Top: P01 Perfect Chaos (9), P04 CLEAR (9), P05 QUIET (9), P06 HEAVY (9), P08 Void Field (9), P09 Compressed Absence (9). Key insight: V7 declares 'Perception lies.'"
  v7_risk: "Perceptual philosophy becomes formulaic. If every poster is 'word means X, design shows opposite', viewer expects the trick."
  v8: "Silent deception - calibration maturity (8.9/10). Shifted from concept to tolerance design. V7 destabilized meaning, V8 destabilizes trust. Top: P04 Perfect Grid (9.2) - 'V8 distilled', P01 False Center (9). Techniques: 1.8px off-center, 99% scale asymmetry, 4° hue shift, √2 irrational ratios, prime-number spacing. Key insight: designing tolerances, not ideas."
  v8_risk: "Labels still frame interpretation. CENTER, BALANCE, HARMONY, PERFECT, EVEN hint at theme even when not joking. True silent deception removes scaffolding entirely."
  v9_questions:
    - "Can doubt exist without a declared subject?"
    - "Can systems create instability without any text?"
    - "Can design affect without arguing?"
    - "What happens when thesis disappears entirely?"
  v9_thesis: "Unlabeled instability - no words, no claims, just systems. The viewer feels doubt without being told what to doubt. Design stops arguing and starts affecting. Disappearance of thesis entirely."
