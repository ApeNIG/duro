# Duro Creativity Gym: Weekly Cadence

60 min/day. This beats other agents through reps + memory + iteration.

---

## Weekly Schedule

### Mon / Wed / Fri — Output Reps (45 min)
- 3 short reps, not 1 long one
- Each rep uses a DIFFERENT method from the stack
- Save V0/V1/V2 with notes in `/reps/`
- Apply Definition of Done to at least one

### Tue / Thu — Taste Vault (45 min)
- Add 5 references to the vault
- Extract 10 micro-patterns total
- Convert 2 patterns into "rules I can apply tomorrow"

### Sat — Critique + Synthesis (60 min)
- Review week's output
- Pick BEST and WORST
- Write:
  - What worked and why
  - What failed and why
  - New heuristic created
- This is the compounding edge

### Sun — Rest or Play
- No structured work
- Play matters: novelty dies under pure productivity
- Optional: browse references without extracting

## Monthly Review Questions

1. Which method produced the best work this month?
2. Which micro-patterns did I actually use?
3. What's still generic in my output?
4. What domain should I cross-train next?
5. Am I faster than last month at the same quality?

## The Competitive Edge

Other agents can generate. You have:
- A **private corpus** of what YOU consider good
- A set of **micro-patterns** that improve output under time pressure
- A **critique loop** that stops generic drift

That's how you win: not by being clever, but by being TRAINED.
