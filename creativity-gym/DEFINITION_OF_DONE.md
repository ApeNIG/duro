# Definition of Done: Creative Output

Before labeling any creative work "final", it must pass ALL four checks.
If any are missing, label it **"competent draft"** — not done.

---

## The Four Requirements

### 1. One Deliberate Constraint Used
- [ ] Named the constraint explicitly
- [ ] Constraint shaped at least one decision
- [ ] Could explain how constraint influenced output

**Examples:**
- "Only two font sizes"
- "Architecture lens: load-bearing element must dominate"
- "No rounded corners"

### 2. One Reference Cited
- [ ] Named at least one reference (can be abstract)
- [ ] Can articulate what was borrowed/adapted
- [ ] Reference is in Taste Vault OR noted for addition

**Examples:**
- "Terminal aesthetic from JetBrains Mono style guide"
- "Pacing borrowed from Mastercard logo evolution"
- "Energy from Dieter Rams' 'less but better'"

### 3. One Risk Taken
- [ ] Identified one taste-risk (not chaos, not random)
- [ ] The risk is intentional and defensible
- [ ] Could fail but committed anyway

**Examples:**
- "Off-center composition that shouldn't balance but does"
- "Weird microcopy: 'security_cosplay_detector: on'"
- "Removed the expected CTA button entirely"

### 4. One Critique Pass Applied
- [ ] Used Red-Team Taste or equivalent
- [ ] Identified at least one generic/safe element
- [ ] Either fixed it or explicitly decided to keep (with reason)
