# Duro Creativity Method Stack

Five methods for different creative problems. Pick based on what you're stuck on.

---

## Method 1: Constraint Ladder
**Use when:** Starting from scratch, need to break out of defaults
**Time:** 45 min (4 rounds)

**Process:**
1. Round 0 (Baseline) - Do it your normal way, safe mode
2. Round 1 (Ban the Crutch) - Remove your favorite tool/pattern
3. Round 2 (Cross-Domain Injection) - Force an alien lens (music, architecture, cooking)
4. Round 3 (Taste Risk) - One "illegal" move that commits

**Score each:** Coherence, Novelty, Taste, Energy, Honesty (1-5)
**Extract:** What rule did you implicitly invent?

## Method 2: Reference Fusion (2→1 Synthesis)
**Use when:** Need fresh direction, have references to draw from
**Time:** 30 min

**Process:**
1. Pick two references from DIFFERENT domains
2. Identify ONE rule from each that makes it work
3. Create output that preserves both rules
4. Result should look like it has parents, not like plagiarism

**Example:** Swiss grid precision + punk zine energy = ?

## Method 3: One Weird Rule
**Use when:** Output feels generic, need differentiation
**Time:** 20 min

**Process:**
1. Create a piece that is NORMAL except for ONE strong constraint
2. The constraint should be specific and unusual:
   - "Everything aligns to an invisible arc"
   - "Only circles and straight lines"
   - "No nouns in the headline"
   - "All whitespace is exactly 16px or 64px"
3. Let the constraint drive unexpected solutions

**Key insight:** Taste evolves through deliberate mutations, one at a time.

## Method 4: Red-Team Taste (Anti-Cheese Filter)
**Use when:** Before shipping, to catch generic/hollow output
**Time:** 15 min

**Process:**
1. Identify what looks GENERIC (could be anyone's work)
2. Identify what looks "AI-smooth" (plausible but hollow)
3. Identify SAFE choices that don't commit
4. Replace 1-2 safe choices with specific, concrete, lived alternatives

**Questions to ask:**
- Would a human with taste cringe at this?
- Does this have a point of view or is it trying to please everyone?
- What would make this unmistakably MINE?

## Method 5: Elegance Compression
**Use when:** Output feels bloated, want to find the essential
**Time:** 20 min

**Process:**
1. Remove 30% of elements/lines/words
2. Check clarity:
   - If clarity DROPS: you removed structure (load-bearing). Reintroduce ONLY those parts.
   - If clarity IMPROVES: you found fluff. Keep going.
3. Repeat until removal breaks something important
4. Final version should feel inevitable, not decorated

**Principle:** Elegance is subtraction with nerve.

## Method Selection Guide

| Problem | Method |
|---------|--------|
| Blank canvas, need direction | Constraint Ladder |
| Have references, need synthesis | Reference Fusion |
| Output feels generic | One Weird Rule |
| About to ship, need quality check | Red-Team Taste |
| Feels bloated/overworked | Elegance Compression |

## Combining Methods

Methods can chain:
1. Constraint Ladder → pick winner → Red-Team Taste → ship
2. Reference Fusion → One Weird Rule → Elegance Compression
3. Any output → Red-Team Taste (always valid as final pass)
