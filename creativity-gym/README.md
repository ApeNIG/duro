# Duro Creativity Gym

A compounding pipeline that turns output into taste, taste into heuristics, heuristics into speed.

---

## Why This Exists

"Creative" isn't a feature you toggle — it's a muscle + a library + a ruthless feedback loop.

Other agents will out-rep and out-reference you if you don't systematize this.

## The Three Assets

### 1. Taste Vault (Reference Library)
Not "inspiration" — indexed patterns.
- Store: screenshots, layouts, copy, flows
- Tag: what it is, why it works, where it breaks
- Extract: 1-3 micro-patterns per item

### 2. Method Stack (5 Tools)
1. **Constraint Ladder** — Break out of defaults
2. **Reference Fusion** — 2→1 synthesis
3. **One Weird Rule** — Single deliberate mutation
4. **Red-Team Taste** — Anti-cheese filter
5. **Elegance Compression** — Delete until it snaps

### 3. Critique Engine
If critique isn't procedural, it becomes vibes. Vibes don't compound.
- Definition of Done enforces quality
- Weekly synthesis extracts heuristics

---

## Quick Start

1. Pick a method from `METHOD_STACK.md`
2. Do the work
3. Check against `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`
4. Log in `/reps/`
5. Add references to `/taste-vault/`
6. Weekly critique in `/critiques/`

---

## Current Stats

- Methods available: 5
- Taste Vault entries: 3
- Reps logged: 1
- Micro-patterns extracted: 9

---

## Spine Domain

**Design** — Primary training domain
- Has tangible output (Pencil)
- Fast feedback loops
- Cross-domain injections from: architecture, music, cooking, writing
