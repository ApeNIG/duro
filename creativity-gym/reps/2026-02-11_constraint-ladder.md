## Session: Constraint Ladder Experiment

**Domain**: Design
**Method**: Constraint Ladder
**Time**: ~45 min
**Output**: Safety System Status Card (4 versions)

---

## Versions

### V0: Baseline
- Standard dashboard card
- Golden ratio sizing (32/20/14/12)
- Conventional hierarchy
- Score: 16/25 (Coherence 4, Novelty 2, Taste 3, Energy 3, Honesty 4)

### V1: No Crutches
- Constraint: Only 2 font sizes, no golden ratio
- Flat terminal list format
- Dividers replace size hierarchy
- Score: 16/25 (Coherence 4, Novelty 3, Taste 3, Energy 2, Honesty 4)

### V2: Architecture Lens (WINNER)
- Constraint: Load-bearing element, circulation path, negative space as structure
- Giant centered 100%, side "rooms" with 1px walls
- Clear eye flow: Entry → Main → Details → Exit
- Score: 22/25 (Coherence 5, Novelty 4, Taste 4, Energy 5, Honesty 4)

### V3: Taste Risk
- Constraint: Weird microcopy that commits
- "security_cosplay_detector: on"
- Ghost number (15% opacity), dotted leaders, keyboard hints
- Score: 21/25 (Coherence 3, Novelty 5, Taste 4, Energy 4, Honesty 5)

## Definition of Done Check (for V2 winner)

- [x] Constraint: Architecture lens (load-bearing, circulation, negative space)
- [x] Reference: Building architecture principles
- [x] Risk: 48px centered number dominating card (unconventional for status card)
- [x] Critique pass: Compared against V0 baseline, identified energy gap

**Status**: Final

## Extracted Rules

1. **Hierarchy = energy distribution** — The biggest element carries the most energy. Remove size hierarchy and you lose punch.

2. **"Load-bearing element"** — Better mental model than "use 32px". Ask: what happens if this fails? Make that impossible to miss.

3. **Design for circulation** — Entry → Main → Details → Exit. Explicit eye movement planning increases coherence.

4. **Weird only works when grounded** — "security_cosplay_detector" works because surrounded by terminal-native elements. Half-weird = random.

5. **Ghost elements add depth** — Low opacity background elements create interest without competing.

- Add architecture-as-UI entry to Taste Vault (done)
- Try Reference Fusion method next session
- Practice Elegance Compression on an existing design
