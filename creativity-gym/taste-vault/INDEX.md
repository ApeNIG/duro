## How to Add Entries

Each entry needs:
1. **Source**: Name, URL, or description
2. **Domain**: design / writing / code / architecture / music / other
3. **What it is**: Layout, pacing, contrast, microcopy, structure, etc.
4. **Why it works**: The principle (1 sentence)
5. **Where it breaks**: When NOT to use this
6. **Micro-patterns**: 1-3 tiny reusable moves extracted

## Entries

### Entry 001: Terminal Minimal Dashboard (Style Guide)
- **Source**: Pencil style guide - Terminal Minimal
- **Domain**: design
- **What it is**: Dark-mode dashboard aesthetic, monospace typography, terminal metaphors
- **Why it works**: Single font + all lowercase + snake_case creates total consistency and developer-native feel
- **Where it breaks**: Consumer apps, non-technical audiences, contexts requiring warmth
- **Micro-patterns**:
  1. Prefix navigation with `>` for active, space for inactive
  2. Comment syntax `//` for subtitles suggests inline documentation
  3. Status as colored text only (no background chips) — cleaner, more terminal-native

### Entry 002: Mastercard Logo Evolution
- **Source**: Mastercard rebrand case study (50-year evolution)
- **Domain**: design
- **What it is**: Geometric circle composition, progressive simplification
- **Why it works**: Earned wordless status through relentless subtraction over decades
- **Where it breaks**: New brands that haven't earned recognition, complex products
- **Micro-patterns**:
  1. Golden ratio sizing between circles (1.0 : 0.62 : 0.38)
  2. 40-45% overlap between adjacent circles — intersection is where meaning lives
  3. Diagonal cascade: larger elements lower/left, smaller upper/right

### Entry 003: Architecture as UI Metaphor
- **Source**: Constraint Ladder experiment V2
- **Domain**: design (cross-domain from architecture)
- **What it is**: Treating UI components like building spaces
- **Why it works**: Forces thinking about eye movement (circulation) and information criticality (load-bearing)
- **Where it breaks**: Dense data tables, contexts where all info is equally important
- **Micro-patterns**:
  1. Load-bearing element = what fails if missed? Make it physically dominant.
  2. Circulation path = Entry → Main hall → Side rooms → Exit
  3. Negative space = structural walls, not decoration. Groups related, separates unrelated.

### Entry 004: Swiss + Punk Fusion
- **Source**: Reference Fusion experiment (2026-02-11)
- **Domain**: design
- **What it is**: Rigid grid structure with rebellious/hand-made elements breaking through
- **Why it works**: Tension between order and chaos creates energy; grid provides credibility, punk provides personality
- **Where it breaks**: If too many punk elements, loses credibility; if too Swiss, loses personality. Needs balance.
- **Micro-patterns**:
  1. Visible grid as design element — show the underlying structure, don't hide it
  2. Rotation as rebellion — one rotated element against rigid grid reads as intentional breaking
  3. Stamp/seal as verification — hand-drawn circle + text creates "approved" energy without being corporate
