## The Question

> "Which has the biggest ROI, which is the most intuitive, which is future-proofing, which is the most enriching. Make it comprehensive. I also want to learn. A new world is being built ahead of us and I want to be part of the builders but do it staying true to our core values."

---

## The Landscape Ahead

AI is becoming commoditized. Soon everyone will have access to powerful LLMs. Differentiation won't come from generation - it will come from:

1. **Orchestration** - Coordinating multiple AI systems
2. **Verification** - Ensuring AI output is correct/safe
3. **Memory** - Structured knowledge that compounds
4. **Domain expertise** - Deep understanding codified into skills

---

## Analysis by Lens

### 1. Biggest ROI

| Skill Area | Why High ROI |
|------------|--------------|
| Verification/QA | AI generates more code → verification becomes the bottleneck. Verify once, trust repeatedly. |
| Pattern extraction | You already notice patterns ("this is like cinematch devkit"). Codify that instinct. |

### 2. Most Intuitive

| Skill Area | Why Natural |
|------------|-------------|
| Pattern extraction | You already notice patterns. Codify that instinct. |

### 3. Future-Proofing

| Skill Area | Why It Lasts |
|------------|--------------|
| Verification intelligence | LLMs will get better at generating. The hard problem is knowing if output is correct. This becomes MORE valuable over time. |
| Multi-agent orchestration | Future is agents coordinating, not single agents. Skills that compose > skills that execute alone. |
| Local memory/knowledge | As AI gets powerful, owning your data/skills = sovereignty. Cloud AI is rented intelligence. |

### 4. Most Enriching

| Skill Area | What You Learn |
|------------|----------------|
| Meta-skills (create_skill, skill_composer) | Learning how to learn. Abstraction thinking. |

---

## Core Values Alignment

| Value | Skill Implications |
|-------|-------------------|
| Execution over explanation | Skills that DO, not just suggest |
| Local first | Skills that run on your machine, own your data |
| Emergent problem solving | Skills that combine in unexpected ways. Composability > completeness |
| Compounding intelligence | Every skill use should make the system smarter. Learning loops built in |
| Structured learning | Skills capture learnings systematically. Memory + rules + facts |

## The Synthesis: Where All Lenses Converge

Two skill domains emerge as highest-value:

### Domain 1: Verification Intelligence

> "As AI generates more, the skill to verify becomes more valuable than the skill to generate."

**Why it wins on all axes:**
- **ROI**: Verification is the new bottleneck. Every verified output = trust earned.
- **Future-proof**: Generation gets commoditized. Verification stays hard.
- **Enriching**: Forces you to deeply understand what "good" looks like. Learning by critique.
- **Values-aligned**: Local standards, actual execution, compounds knowledge.

**Skills to build:**
```
design_to_code_verifier (exists - enhance)
       ↓
code_quality_verifier (new)
       ↓
test_coverage_analyzer (new)
       ↓
accessibility_verifier (new)
       ↓
security_scanner (new)
```

The insight: These aren't separate skills - they're a **verification stack**. Each layer catches what the previous missed.

### Domain 2: Skill Composition & Meta-Learning

> "The most powerful skill is the skill that creates and combines skills."

**Why it wins on all axes:**
- **ROI**: One good meta-skill = infinite derived skills.
- **Future-proof**: AI changes fast. Abstraction survives change.
- **Enriching**: Forces pattern thinking, composability, architecture.
- **Values-aligned**: Compounding intelligence at its purest.

**Skills to build:**
```
create_skill (exists - enhance)
       ↓
skill_composer (new - chains skills)
       ↓
skill_evaluator (new - measures effectiveness)
```

## The Deeper Truth

> "A new world is being built ahead of us and I want to be part of the builders."

**The builders who matter won't be those who can generate the most. They'll be those who can:**
- **Verify** what's true
- **Compose** what's useful
- **Remember** what's learned

That's what Duro is becoming. That's what these skills serve.

## Implementation Path

Started with Verification Intelligence:
1. Enhanced `design_to_code_verifier` - wired to MSJ devkit
2. Built `code_quality_verifier` - 12 rules across TS, React, Security
3. Built `skill_composer` - sequential pipeline for chaining
4. Created `skill_runner.py` - spine with timeouts, suppressions

Full plan: `~/.agent/proposals/pending/verification-intelligence-plan.md`
