inputs:
  prompt:
    type: string
    description: Image generation prompt
  output_path:
    type: file
    description: Where to save the image
  contains_face:
    type: boolean
    description: Does the image contain human faces?

expected_outputs:
  - name: file_exists
    type: boolean
    description: Image file is created
  - name: min_file_size
    type: constraint
    description: Image is at least 50KB (not corrupted)
    threshold: 51200
  - name: quality_acceptable
    type: boolean
    description: Image quality meets requirements (especially faces)

validation_steps:
  - Check if contains_face is true
  - If true, check rule_001 (face distortion) applies
  - Generate image using appropriate method
  - Verify file exists and meets size threshold
  - Manual quality check for faces

  - "Free APIs produce distorted faces - see rule_001"
  - "For faces, recommend web tools (DALL-E, Gemini)"
  - "Non-face images can be automated"
