### [00:01] Task Completed
**Task:** Write and produce Episode 1C: The Confrontation
**Outcome:** Created research-grounded script showing all family wounds colliding. Generated 12 audio files via edge-tts directly (lesson applied: no orchestration overhead). Committed to GitHub.

### [00:01] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** Run edge-tts directly via 'python -m edge_tts' instead of through Duro skill orchestration. Direct execution completes in seconds; orchestrated skill times out. Apply the simplest tool for the job.
