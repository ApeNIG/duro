# Memory Log - 2026-02-12

### [00:05] Learnings
**Learning (Architecture):** Safety system now has 9 invariants (S1-S9) all enforced at host level via Hookify. S9 (fail-closed) is the capstone - system refuses to operate without guardrails. This closes the "security cosplay" gap where verification warned but didn't block. The maintenance triad is complete: test-safety-gates.py (21 tests), verify-safety-system.py (5 checks), test-fail-closed.py (3 tests), restore-hooks.py (3 hooks).

### [00:06] Task Completed
**Task:** Full session: Render MCP setup + Fail-closed safety implementation
**Outcome:** 1) Connected Render MCP, listed services/deploys/logs/metrics, added UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY to intersphere-api. 2) Implemented S9 fail-closed invariant: UserPromptSubmit hook verifies safety gates on first prompt of day, blocks ALL operations if compromised. Tests pass, docs updated, pushed to GitHub.

### [00:06] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** Session workflow for infrastructure + safety work: Start with operational tasks (Render MCP, env vars, deploys), then tackle architectural improvements (fail-closed gate). Both benefit from immediate testing and verification. The session covered the full stack: cloud ops (Render) → local safety (Hookify) → documentation (threat model).

### [00:11] Investigation Summary
## Intersphere API Performance Analysis (2026-02-12)

**Project Location:** C:/Users/sibag/Desktop/BUILD/intersphere/api

### Key Findings

**8-Second Cold Start Root Cause:**
The problem is a **sequential waterfall of external API calls** for new topics, combined with **expensive OpenAI GPT calls**.

### Request Flow for /cards/query
1. **Cache Check** (fast, ~10ms if hit)
2. **Wikipedia Fetch** (parallel with Openverse)
   - `https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/{title}` (~500-800ms)
3. **Openverse Image Search** (parallel)
   - `https://api.openverse.org/v1/images/` (~800-1200ms)
4. **Category Classification** with OpenAI
   - GPT call to classify topic (~1-2 seconds)
5. **Unsplash Image Search** (if no Openverse results)
   - ~500-1000ms
6. **Quiz Generation** (if requested)
   - GPT-4o-mini call: ~2-3 seconds
7. **Path Discovery** (if connections requested)
   - Recursive Wikipedia + LLM calls (~variable, 2-5 seconds)

**Actual Sequence:**
- compose_card (steps 2-3 parallel): ~1.5s
- classify_topic: ~1.5s (sequential)
- generate_topic_image (step 5): ~500ms
- Quiz generation (step 6): ~2-3s (sequential)
- Connections (step 7): ~2-5s
- **Total: 8-12 seconds cold**

### Current Caching Strategy
- **Type:** DiskCache (SQLite-based, file: `./cache_dir`)
- **Implementation:** Shared singleton in `app.state.cache` (good!)
- **TTLs:** 24 hours for cards, 30 days for quizzes, permanent for categories
- **Size Limit:** 256MB (configurable)
- **Issue:** Cache keys are strict (e.g., `card:python` vs `card:Python`)

### External API Calls
1. **Wikipedia** - Required for all topics (no cache, no backup)
2. **Unsplash** - High-quality images (50 req/hr free tier, cached permanently)
3. **Openverse** - CC-licensed fallback images
4. **OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini)** - Quiz & category generation (~$0.0003/call)
5. **OpenAI (GPT-4)** - Path discovery connections

### Performance Bottlenecks

**Critical Paths:**
1. **Quiz Generation** (2-3 seconds)
   - File: `quiz_generator.py`
   - Makes single GPT-4o-mini call with full Wikipedia text
   - Always runs for full /cards/query even if user doesn't request it
   - Not parallelized with other operations

2. **Category Classification** (1-2 seconds)
   - File: `category_classifier.py` (not read, but referenced)
   - Runs sequentially after Wikipedia fetch
   - Called for every topic request

3. **Path Discovery** (/connections endpoint) (2-5 seconds)
   - File: `path_discovery.py`
   - Bidirectional tree search with recursive connections calls
   - Uses get_related_concepts_async which chains LLM calls
   - No depth limit in default implementation

4. **Image Generation** (500ms-2s)
   - Unsplash search is fast (~500ms) but sometimes times out
   - Falls back to Openverse if Unsplash unavailable

### Existing Optimizations
✅ Shared httpx.AsyncClient for connection pooling
✅ Wikipedia + Openverse parallelized in compose_card
✅ DiskCache singleton (prevents corruption)
✅ Rate limiting (30/min for quiz, 100/min for analytics)
✅ Category classification cached permanently

### Missing Optimizations
❌ Quiz generation NOT parallelized (runs after all other operations)
❌ No client-side caching (SWR not installed)
❌ No Redis or Upstash edge caching
❌ No request batching for Unsplash
❌ No early response timeout (Vercel 10s hard limit)
❌ Quiz shouldn't auto-generate unless explicitly requested

### File Structure
- **app/main.py** - Entry point, health checks, quiz endpoints
- **app/routers/cards.py** - /cards/query, /cards/preview, /cards/explore
- **app/routers/connections_router.py** - /connections/* endpoints
- **app/service.py** - compose_card (Wikipedia + Openverse)
- **app/connections.py** - Curated & Wikipedia-based connections (huge!)
- **quiz_generator.py** - GPT quiz generation
- **app/image_generator.py** - Unsplash + DALL-E
- **app/path_discovery.py** - Bidirectional path finding
- **app/category_classifier.py** - AI topic categorization
- **app/wikipedia_analyzer.py** - Wikipedia link extraction


### [00:18] Task Completed
**Task:** Intersphere API performance optimization
**Outcome:** Deployed successfully. Changes: 1) Parallelized category + image fetch using asyncio.gather() (saves 1-2s), 2) Changed include_quiz default to false on both backend and frontend (saves 2-3s), 3) Created prewarm_cache.py script for warming popular topics. Backend deploy live on Render, frontend deploy pushed to Vercel. Expected improvement: 8s → 3-4s for cold topic loads.

### [05:03] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** When optimizing API performance, check both backend defaults AND frontend code that may override them. The Intersphere frontend was explicitly passing include_quiz=true, negating the backend optimization until the frontend was also updated.

### [05:03] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** asyncio.gather() is effective for parallelizing independent async operations in FastAPI. Used it to run category classification and image fetch simultaneously, saving 1-2 seconds per request.

### [05:03] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** Render MCP workspace selection resets between tool calls - need to call list_workspaces again if getting "no workspace set" errors.

### [05:03] Task Completed
**Task:** Intersphere performance optimization - full deployment
**Outcome:** Successfully deployed both backend (Render) and frontend (Vercel) optimizations. Changes: 1) Parallelized category + image fetch with asyncio.gather() (1-2s savings), 2) Changed include_quiz default to false on backend AND frontend (2-3s savings), 3) Created prewarm_cache.py script. Verified via Render logs that frontend is now sending include_quiz=false. Cached responses under 1 second. Expected cold topic improvement: 8s → 3-4s.

### [06:03] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** Quiz page timeout handling: Use AbortController with 8-second timeout to stay within Vercel's 10-second function limit. On timeout, gracefully skip to next item rather than showing errors. Client-side resilience is critical when backend operations are slow.

### [06:03] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** Cache pre-warming for slow operations: Created separate prewarm_quiz.py script for quiz-specific warming (8-10s per topic) vs general prewarm_cache.py (1-2s per topic). Use --force flag to clear bad cache states. Lower concurrency (2) for expensive operations.

### [06:03] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** WebFetch tool limitation: Returns HTTP 200 pages but may misinterpret React/Next.js hydration as 404 errors. The "notFound" prop in Next.js RSC payload is a fallback, not the actual rendered content. Use curl to verify actual page content when WebFetch reports issues.

### [06:03] Task Completed
**Task:** Fix Intersphere quiz page with resilient timeout handling
**Outcome:** Added AbortController with 8s timeout, graceful skip to next topic on timeout/error, include_quiz=true in API call. Quiz page now handles slow backend gracefully instead of breaking. Created prewarm_quiz.py script for caching quiz data (10 topics warmed successfully). Committed and deployed to Vercel.

### [06:09] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** Store design principles as UNIVERSAL knowledge, not project-specific. "Sonora geometric formula" should be "geometric composition principles" - the project is just one application context. Overly specific naming limits knowledge reuse and transfer.

### [06:21] User Context Update
**Current Focus (Feb 2026):**
- Primary: Intersphere + Design skills
- Safety systems: Solid, maintain but don't over-engineer
- Budget: Constrained - pre-revenue phase
- Goal: Build skills to confidently offer paid services

**Key Projects to Know:**
1. Intersphere - Knowledge exploration tool (active)
2. Cinematch - Need to learn about this
3. epiphanys-global-bridge - Need to learn about this

**Feedback:** Doing great work, no annoyances reported.

### [06:39] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Abstract/Dynamic Design Principles (2026): 1) Motion as brand identity - consistent timing curves and easing that become recognizable markers. 2) Quiet but smart motion - less showy animations, more rhythmic/purposeful micro-movements. 3) Progressive disclosure - content reveals through scroll/interaction, not all at once. 4) Layered gradients with blend modes (screen, overlay, multiply) for dimensional effects. 5) Typography as motion - variable fonts, staggered character animations, letter-spacing changes on scroll. 6) Depth without imagery - shadows, layers, spacing, and stacking contexts create dimensionality. 7) Scroll-based storytelling (scrollytelling) - mixed directional narratives, chapter-like progression.

### [06:39] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** Motion implementation best practices: Use requestAnimationFrame for 60fps performance. Calculate scroll position ratios for smooth transitions. Apply consistent brand-specific timing curves across all animations. Micro-interactions should respond proportionally (not binary on/off). Stagger animations create rhythm - delay children slightly from each other. Spring physics feels more natural than linear easing. Gesture-based interactions (drag, swipe) need momentum/inertia.

### [06:45] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** CSS 3D Transform patterns: 1) Perspective values - shallow 600-800px for moderate depth, deep 1000-2000px for subtle effects, extreme 75em+ for dramatic close-ups. 2) Always use transform-style: preserve-3d on parent for nested 3D. 3) Use will-change: transform for GPU acceleration. 4) Hover patterns: combine perspective + rotateY + scale transitions at 0.4s ease-in-out. 5) backface-visibility: hidden prevents flicker. 6) Transitions 0.2-0.7s optimal for performance.

### [06:45] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** Mesh gradient implementation: 1) Layer multiple radial-gradient() with 'at X% Y%' positioning. 2) Each gradient fades to transparent at 50% for soft blending. 3) Animate with background-size: 1400% 1400% and background-position keyframes 0% 2% -> 100% 99% -> 0% 2%. 4) Use 30-45s duration for subtle, ambient movement. 5) For performance-critical apps, use WebGL (Stripe's approach) - only 10kb, GPU-rendered. CSS animations cause CPU/RAM strain on complex gradients.

### [06:45] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** GSAP ScrollTrigger patterns: 1) Always gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger) to prevent tree-shaking. 2) Pin sections with pin: true, end: '+=500' for scroll distance. 3) Scrub links animation to scrollbar - use scrub: 1 for 1-second smoothing. 4) Start/end use 'top center', 'bottom 80%' syntax. 5) toggleActions: 'play pause resume reset' controls 4 scroll states. 6) snap: 'labels' for section snapping. 7) markers: true for debugging. 8) Animate children of pinned elements, not the pinned element itself.

### [06:52] Task Completed
**Task:** Implement 3D card hover effects for Intersphere
**Outcome:** Added perspective-container and card-3d CSS classes to globals.css. Enhanced EditorialCard with Framer Motion 3D rotateX/rotateY on hover. Applied card-3d-subtle to homepage feature cards and Everything Connects section. Build passing.

### [07:01] Task Completed
**Task:** Add GSAP scrollytelling to Intersphere homepage
**Outcome:** Installed GSAP + ScrollTrigger. Created useScrollAnimation hook. Added scroll-triggered animations: Featured section stagger, feature cards with 3D rotation entrance, connection dots with back.out easing, How It Works stagger, CTA dramatic reveal. Homepage JS increased from 4KB to 49KB (GSAP bundle). Build passing, deployed.

### [07:07] Task Completed
**Task:** Add animated mesh gradient to Intersphere hero
**Outcome:** Created MeshGradient component with 5 presets (warm, cool, aurora, sunset, ocean). Uses layered radial gradients with dual-layer animation for organic depth. Added to hero section with warm preset, 25s animation, 60% opacity. Includes noise texture overlay. Build passing, deployed.

### [09:41] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** When a git repository has corrupted file paths (e.g., files with carriage returns like `.env.local\r`), use sparse-checkout to work around the issue: `git sparse-checkout init --cone && git sparse-checkout set <directories>`. This allows checking out specific directories while ignoring problematic paths.

### [09:41] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** When force push is blocked by hooks, create a feature branch and push there instead, then merge via PR. This avoids destructive operations while still getting changes to remote.

### [09:41] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** InterSphere uses auto-generated type files (card.d.ts) with versioned type names like `KnowledgeCardV1B`. When components need simpler names, add type aliases for backwards compatibility rather than renaming everywhere.

### [09:41] Task Completed
**Task:** Add dark theme support to InterSphere topic detail page
**Outcome:** Successfully added theme prop to PathExplorer, StoryTab, NowCard, SectionLabel, StoryBeatsCarousel, StoryCard, ExpandedBeatView, FullStoryView components. Merged via PR #17.

### [09:41] Task Completed
**Task:** Fix deployment error - KnowledgeCard type not found
**Outcome:** Added type alias `KnowledgeCard = KnowledgeCardV1B` in card.d.ts for backwards compatibility. Build passes, pushed to main.

### [09:41] Task Completed
**Task:** Handle corrupted git repository with invalid file paths
**Outcome:** Used sparse-checkout to clone fresh copy excluding corrupted root files (.env.local\r, .venv\r/). Working copy available at intersphere-fresh.

### [09:48] Pending Tasks
InterSphere repo cleanup pending:
- Old corrupted repo at: C:/Users/sibag/Desktop/BUILD/intersphere (needs manual deletion)
- Fresh working repo at: C:/Users/sibag/Desktop/BUILD/intersphere-fresh
- After terminal restart, run:
  ```
  rm -rf C:/Users/sibag/Desktop/BUILD/intersphere
  mv C:/Users/sibag/Desktop/BUILD/intersphere-fresh C:/Users/sibag/Desktop/BUILD/intersphere
  ```
- Fresh repo uses sparse-checkout (web, server, shared) to avoid corrupted root files
- Dark theme changes are live on main, deployment should be working

### [11:01] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** When implementing designs from pencil.dev mock-ups for Intersphere: 1) Always systematically list ALL mock-ups first and cross-reference with ALL pages in codebase. 2) Don't just update colors - match the actual layout structure, spacing, and component hierarchy. 3) Verify each page visually after deployment. User confirmed Homepage and Explore look great, but Search, Discover, Quiz, and Topic Detail pages need more layout work beyond just dark theme colors.

### [11:02] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** When implementing UI designs from mock-ups, be thorough: 1) List ALL pages in the codebase first, 2) List ALL mock-ups available, 3) Create a mapping between them, 4) Update each systematically, 5) Verify EVERY page visually after deployment - don't assume completion. Missing the Search page dark theme update was a failure to be systematic.

### [11:02] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** Pencil.dev MCP tools: Use batch_get with readDepth parameter to inspect mock-up structure. Node IDs can be used to get specific components. The mock-ups contain exact colors, fonts, spacing that should be matched - not just approximated.

### [11:02] Task Completed
**Task:** Implement pencil.dev mock-up designs for Intersphere pages
**Outcome:** Partially complete. Updated Explore, Discover, Quiz, Search pages to dark theme. Homepage and Explore confirmed looking good. Search, Discover, Quiz, Topic Detail need more layout refinement beyond color changes. User not fully satisfied with layouts.

### [11:11] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** METR research shows AI autonomous capability (time horizon) doubles every 7 months, but practical productivity is nuanced - experienced developers were 19% slower with AI tools in controlled study. Use METR's evaluation frameworks (RE-Bench, MALT, Autonomy Evals) as reference for assessing AI capabilities.

### [11:23] Learnings
**Learning (Research):** When researching AI tools, always verify claims from official sources (GitHub repos, official docs, peer-reviewed papers). Marketing pages may overstate capabilities. GitHub star counts and paper citations provide credibility signals.

### [11:23] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** The AI agent memory landscape has converged on key patterns: (1) temporal validity for facts, (2) knowledge graphs for relationships, (3) separation of factual vs experiential memory, (4) self-improvement through outcome tracking. Duro should incorporate these patterns incrementally.

### [11:23] Task Completed
**Task:** Research AI agent memory tools using SuperAGI to identify improvements for Duro
**Outcome:** Completed. Verified 4 major tools (Mem0, Zep, Letta, Cognee) and 1 academic survey. Identified 5 actionable improvements: temporal fact validity, fact-decision linking, confidence decay, skill success tracking, and episodic memory structure. All findings saved to Duro with proper source attribution.

### [11:24] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** SuperAGI's web_search and read_webpage tools are effective for research tasks. Workflow: (1) broad search to identify tools, (2) read official GitHub repos/docs for verification, (3) cross-reference with academic papers for credibility. This produced higher quality findings than relying on search snippets alone.

### [11:24] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** Key GitHub star counts for AI memory tools (Feb 2026): Mem0 (47.2k), Letta (21.1k), Cognee (12.3k). These indicate community adoption levels and can help prioritize which tools to evaluate first.

### [11:24] Task Completed
**Task:** Session: Duro improvement research using SuperAGI
**Outcome:** Successfully researched AI agent memory landscape. Identified and verified 4 tools (Mem0, Zep, Letta, Cognee) and 1 academic survey. Stored 5 facts, 2 decisions, and 4 learnings to Duro. All sources verified from official GitHub repos and arXiv papers per user request for reliable sources.

### [11:29] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** The system architecture has clear separation: SuperAGI MCP = action layer (web search, code execution, file ops, GitHub), Duro = memory layer (facts, decisions, skills, rules). When improving capabilities, target the appropriate layer.

### [11:29] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic solves M×N integration problem - instead of each AI app needing custom connectors to each tool, MCP creates unified interface. SuperAGI's MCP server wraps their toolkit ecosystem for standardized access.
