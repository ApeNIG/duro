### [04:51] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** Hershey fonts are public domain single-stroke vector glyphs (designed for pen plotters) that enable generative typography. Unlike filled fonts, each letter is an SVG path you trace with a single line. The key to organic hand-drawn effects is applying perpendicular wave motion to each stroke using deterministic seeded randomness (Math.sin(seed * 12.9898 + 78.233) * 43758.5453).

### [04:51] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** Production-quality generative typography uses 4 layers: (1) blur layer for soft glow, (2) shadow layer for depth, (3) core layer for main strokes, (4) accent layer for highlights. Each layer has different strokeWidth, opacity, and offset values. The OrganicTextRefined component in InterSphere demonstrates this pattern.

### [04:51] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** Internal design documentation pages (like /demo/lines) that serve as both live demos AND technical references are extremely valuable. They preserve design iteration history, provide API documentation, show roadmap status, and let designers/developers see all variations in one place. Worth creating for any significant visual system.

### [04:51] Task Completed
**Task:** Daily Discovery frontend wiring - created API routes, client library, and /daily page
**Outcome:** Successfully built and deployed. 14 files changed, 2427 insertions. Committed and pushed to GitHub. Local testing confirmed working with backend.

### [04:51] Task Completed
**Task:** Comprehensive study of /demo/lines generative typography system
**Outcome:** Documented complete understanding: Hershey fonts, seededRandom algorithm, flowingPath perpendicular wave motion, 9+ OrganicText variations, multi-layer rendering (blur/shadow/core/accent), Fingerprint component API, and typography roadmap.
