### [06:53] Task Completed
**Task:** Add ComfyUI backend to Duro image_generate.py skill
**Outcome:** Successfully added ComfyUI as new backend option. Changes: (1) SDK import with graceful fallback, (2) COMFYUI enum value, (3) ComfyUI config entries (base_url, api_key_env, timeout, poll_interval, steps, cfg_scale, sampler), (4) generate_comfyui handler with full error handling, (5) Handler registered in BACKEND_HANDLERS, (6) Default fallback order: Pollinations -> ComfyUI -> DALL-E -> Stock, (7) SKILL_META bumped to v1.1.0 with 600s timeout

### [07:25] Task Completed
**Task:** Add production-quality AI generation backends (Flux, Kling, Minimax) and cost estimator
**Outcome:** Successfully implemented: (1) Flux via FAL.ai backend for image_generate.py (~$0.04/image, excellent quality), (2) video_generate.py skill with Minimax/Hailuo (~$0.27/6s) and Kling AI (~$0.30/5s) backends, (3) production_cost_estimator.py for calculating costs before jobs run. Updated skills/index.json with all new skills.

### [07:27] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** For production-quality AI generation on a budget: Flux via FAL.ai ($0.04/image) matches DALL-E quality at same cost but faster. Minimax/Hailuo ($0.27/6s video) has free tier and is 50% cheaper than Runway. Kling AI ($0.30/5s) offers best motion quality. Always build a cost estimator skill when adding paid backends - users need to validate budgets before running jobs.

### [07:27] Learnings
**Learning (User Preference):** When user has hardware limitations (can't run local AI models) and cost constraints (RunPod too expensive), focus on: (1) Free tiers first (Pollinations, Minimax free), (2) Per-use APIs over subscriptions for low volume, (3) Cost comparison tools to find optimal backends per job.

### [07:27] Task Completed
**Task:** Session: Add production-quality AI backends to Duro skills
**Outcome:** Completed full implementation: (1) ComfyUI backend for image_generate.py, (2) Flux via FAL.ai backend, (3) video_generate.py with Minimax/Hailuo + Kling AI, (4) production_cost_estimator.py for budget planning. Two commits pushed: 838a1db (ComfyUI) and 44972b3 (Flux, video gen, cost estimator). User now has professional-grade generation stack at ~$2-3 per typical production.

### [07:55] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** Design workflow for alabi-portfolio and similar projects: ALWAYS use Pencil.dev to create mockups first, evaluate them visually, iterate on what's working, and only then implement in code. This allows for faster iteration and better design outcomes. Never skip the mockup phase.

### [07:55] Learnings
**Learning (User Preference):** Never assume or make up personal information like names. If a name or personal detail isn't explicitly provided, ask the user. Names are critical - getting them wrong is unacceptable. User's name: Alabi Ibagun.

### [07:59] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** Design workflow (corrected): 1) Open Pencil.dev, 2) Create mockup variations, 3) In autonomous mode: rate your own work and self-critique (this builds better judgment), 4) Iterate on the design based on self-evaluation, 5) Only then implement in code. Self-rating develops stronger creative instincts.

### [08:19] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Swiss Clean design system for SaaS dashboards: Zero corner radius, single red accent (#E42313), Space Grotesk for headings + Inter for body, #0D0D0D soft black for text, #E8E8E8 borders, generous spacing. Geometric logo marks, red dot indicators for active nav states.

### [08:19] Task Completed
**Task:** Redesigned seto-rota application with Swiss Clean design system
**Outcome:** Created Pencil.dev mockups (Login + Dashboard), self-rated and iterated designs to 8.5/10, then implemented: globals.css design tokens, split-screen auth layout, Swiss Clean login form, geometric sidebar with red active indicators, design-tokens.ts utility. Full workflow: mockup → critique → iterate → implement.

### [13:13] Task Completed
**Task:** Set up remote Claude access via Telegram with Duro memory
**Outcome:** Successfully deployed Claude Telegram bot on DigitalOcean droplet ($6/month). Features: 24/7 availability, Duro memory integration, voice note transcription with Whisper AI, Notion/Vercel MCP access. User can now chat with Claude from phone with full context and memory. Server: 165.22.115.170

### [13:13] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** Claude Code's -p (print) mode requires --allowedTools flag to auto-approve MCP tools. Without it, MCP tools like Duro require interactive permission approval which doesn't work in non-interactive mode.

### [13:13] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** To add local MCP servers to Claude Code, use 'claude mcp add <name> <command> <args>' - this writes to .claude.json project config. Settings in ~/.claude/settings.json may not be loaded the same way.

### [13:14] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** For Telegram bots with voice support: Use faster-whisper (tiny model) for efficient transcription on low-RAM servers. Telegram sends voice as .ogg files. Bot workflow: download voice -> transcribe with Whisper -> send to Claude -> return response.
