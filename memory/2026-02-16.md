### [06:53] Task Completed
**Task:** Add ComfyUI backend to Duro image_generate.py skill
**Outcome:** Successfully added ComfyUI as new backend option. Changes: (1) SDK import with graceful fallback, (2) COMFYUI enum value, (3) ComfyUI config entries (base_url, api_key_env, timeout, poll_interval, steps, cfg_scale, sampler), (4) generate_comfyui handler with full error handling, (5) Handler registered in BACKEND_HANDLERS, (6) Default fallback order: Pollinations -> ComfyUI -> DALL-E -> Stock, (7) SKILL_META bumped to v1.1.0 with 600s timeout

### [07:25] Task Completed
**Task:** Add production-quality AI generation backends (Flux, Kling, Minimax) and cost estimator
**Outcome:** Successfully implemented: (1) Flux via FAL.ai backend for image_generate.py (~$0.04/image, excellent quality), (2) video_generate.py skill with Minimax/Hailuo (~$0.27/6s) and Kling AI (~$0.30/5s) backends, (3) production_cost_estimator.py for calculating costs before jobs run. Updated skills/index.json with all new skills.

### [07:27] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** For production-quality AI generation on a budget: Flux via FAL.ai ($0.04/image) matches DALL-E quality at same cost but faster. Minimax/Hailuo ($0.27/6s video) has free tier and is 50% cheaper than Runway. Kling AI ($0.30/5s) offers best motion quality. Always build a cost estimator skill when adding paid backends - users need to validate budgets before running jobs.

### [07:27] Learnings
**Learning (User Preference):** When user has hardware limitations (can't run local AI models) and cost constraints (RunPod too expensive), focus on: (1) Free tiers first (Pollinations, Minimax free), (2) Per-use APIs over subscriptions for low volume, (3) Cost comparison tools to find optimal backends per job.

### [07:27] Task Completed
**Task:** Session: Add production-quality AI backends to Duro skills
**Outcome:** Completed full implementation: (1) ComfyUI backend for image_generate.py, (2) Flux via FAL.ai backend, (3) video_generate.py with Minimax/Hailuo + Kling AI, (4) production_cost_estimator.py for budget planning. Two commits pushed: 838a1db (ComfyUI) and 44972b3 (Flux, video gen, cost estimator). User now has professional-grade generation stack at ~$2-3 per typical production.
