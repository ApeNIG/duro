# Memory Log - 2026-02-17

### [02:16] Learnings
**Learning (Creative):** AI video production with stock images + TTS = technically works but emotionally flat. For narrative content like The Fashanus, need: (1) consistent character imagery, (2) real voice acting or better voice direction, (3) music/ambient soundscape, (4) motion on stills. The pipeline works; the craft needs more.

### [02:17] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** Phase 4.4 production testing validated the full Duro eval pipeline: episode → actions → close → evaluate → apply. Confidence deltas work correctly (+0.01 per reinforcement). System is production-ready for tracking creative workflows.

### [02:17] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** edge-tts is free and works well for prototyping voiceovers, but lacks emotional range needed for narrative content. Voice assignment: en-GB-SoniaNeural for British female characters. Rate parameter (-10% to -15%) helps with pacing.

### [02:17] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** moviepy 2.x API changes: use `resized(new_size=)` not `resize(newsize=)`, use `with_duration()` not `set_duration()`, use `with_audio()` not `set_audio()`. Effects API changed significantly - skip fades for quick prototypes.

### [02:17] Task Completed
**Task:** Phase 4.4 Production Testing - complete session
**Outcome:** Completed both synthetic episode test and real production test (The Fashanus Episode 1). Eval pipeline validated. Produced 35-sec video at $0 cost. User feedback: technically works but emotionally flat - need consistent characters, real voice acting, music. Key learning: pipeline works, craft needs more.

### [02:41] Learnings
**Learning (Architecture):** Keyword-gated retrieval creates blind spots for new domains. Proactive recall failed for 'design' because it wasn't in RETRIEVAL_TRIGGERS. Every new skill domain would have the same problem. Semantic search should be the default path.

### [02:52] Task Completed
**Task:** Implemented Option C semantic-first proactive recall architecture
**Outcome:** Modified proactive.py to always search semantically regardless of hot path classification. Keywords now boost scores (+0.05 per tag overlap) instead of gating access. Changed search_mode to 'semantic_first', lowered min_confidence to 0.2. This fix applies to ALL skill domains - current and future - without requiring keyword additions for each new domain.

### [02:52] Learnings
**Learning (Architecture):** Keyword-based retrieval gating creates blind spots for new skill domains. Semantic search should always run first, with keywords boosting relevance rather than blocking access. This ensures memory works for any domain without manual keyword additions.

### [03:45] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** When debugging "vec_score always 0" issues in Duro semantic search: (1) First verify the database has cosine distance configured with migration status check, (2) Test vector_search directly with Python to confirm embeddings work, (3) Check for key name mismatches between hybrid_search output and explain_score input - the actual keys are "vec_score" and "fts_score", not "vector" and "bm25".

### [03:45] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** The Duro MCP database is at index.db (not index.sqlite). Path: ~/.agent/memory/index.db. Always check MCP server config (settings.json) for actual paths before debugging.

### [03:45] Task Completed
**Task:** Debug and fix vec_score showing 0.00 in Duro semantic search
**Outcome:** Found key name mismatch in ranking_config.py:explain_score() - was looking for "vector"/"bm25" but hybrid_search creates "vec_score"/"fts_score". Fixed lines 290 and 299. Cosine distance migration was correctly applied, embeddings work fine (0.70+ similarity scores), only the explain text display was wrong.

### [03:51] Task Completed
**Task:** Test and commit explain_score key name fix
**Outcome:** Verified vec_score/fts_score keys work correctly, committed and pushed fix (97eceea)

### [03:51] Task Completed
**Task:** Commit and push pending duro-mcp changes
**Outcome:** Committed 5 changes: semantic-first proactive recall, deferred startup, embeddings fallback, design autocapture category, and 2 migrations. All pushed to origin (bdf736a)

### [03:51] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** When refactoring dict key names (e.g., "vector" to "vec_score"), search entire codebase for all usages - downstream functions like explain_score may reference old keys and silently return defaults instead of actual values.

### [04:48] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** When debugging recurring problems, always investigate root cause not just symptoms. Recent changes (like new server setups) are prime suspects. Think about the full system: multiple machines, sync mechanisms, shared repos, CI/CD. When user points to a clue, follow it immediately.

### [04:48] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** Design workout progression: Start with maximum constraints (B&W, one font, no icons) to prove clarity, then layer in systems (grid, spacing, one accent), then add style with purpose. The 20% trim test genuinely improves designs - removing secondary CTAs, detail paragraphs, and obvious labels sharpens focus.

### [04:48] Task Completed
**Task:** Design Workout: LORE CRM Landing Page (3 rounds)
**Outcome:** Completed all 3 rounds. R1: B&W clarity (passed). R2: Systems with 8pt grid + accent (40/50). R3: Quiet Luxury with iterations (45/50). Applied 20% trim and conversion optimizations (mockup, metrics, testimonial, transformation narrative).

### [04:48] Task Completed
**Task:** Fix Duro MCP config sync conflict
**Outcome:** Root cause: DigitalOcean server auto-syncing Linux paths to shared GitHub repo, overwriting Windows config. Fix: Added config.json to .gitignore, created config.default.json template. Each platform now keeps its own config.

### [05:21] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** Build instrumentation, not frameworks. The framework (3-pass loop, 48-hour rule, change ledger) only becomes behavior when it's encoded as tools with enforced workflows. Willpower doesn't scale; tools do.

### [05:21] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** New Duro artifact types for debugging: incident_rca (6-field RCA), recent_change (change ledger), design_reference (taste library), checklist_template (process templates). Query recent changes with duro_query_recent_changes(hours=48, risk_tags=[...]) for the 48-hour rule.

### [05:21] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** Identity logging on service startup prevents "mystery bugs": log hostname, git commit, config path, db path. Created new_service_checklist template with code snippets for Python and Node.

### [05:21] Task Completed
**Task:** Build Duro instrumentation system for root cause analysis
**Outcome:** Added 4 new artifact types (incident_rca, recent_change, design_reference, checklist_template), 5 new MCP tools, created new_service_checklist template. All tests pass, pushed to both duro-mcp and .agent repos.

### [05:21] Task Completed
**Task:** Design Workout: LORE CRM Landing Page
**Outcome:** Completed 3 rounds (B&W clarity, Systems, Quiet Luxury). Final score 45/50. Applied 20% trim and conversion optimizations. Learnings saved to .claude/learnings/

### [05:21] Task Completed
**Task:** Fix Duro MCP config sync conflict (root cause analysis)
**Outcome:** Root cause: DO server auto-syncing Linux paths to shared GitHub repo. Fix: Added config.json to .gitignore, created config.default.json template. First incident_rca artifact created as proof of concept.

### [05:42] Learnings
**Learning (Architecture):** When building enforcement mechanisms (gates, guardrails), put enforcement INSIDE the storage function, not as a separate ritual. Users won't remember to call a separate check - but they can't avoid the storage function. The debug gate works because it's in store_incident, not a separate validate_before_close tool.

### [05:42] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** For debugging discipline: the 3-pass sequence is Repro → Boundary → Causality (with 48h scan). The 48-hour scan is only useful AFTER you know what boundary you're looking at. Order matters.

### [05:42] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** Ban handwaving prevention phrases programmatically: "be careful", "remember to", "double check", "pay attention". Force actionable prevention with verb + artifact pattern (e.g., "Add startup log", "Assert X exists", "Add smoke test").

### [05:42] Task Completed
**Task:** Build Debug Gate enforcement for Duro incident RCA
**Outcome:** Shipped hard gate in store_incident: 3 passes (repro, boundary, causality+48h scan) + actionable prevention check. Override mechanism with waiver trail. Auto-runs 48h scan, infers risk_tags. New helper tools: debug_gate_start, debug_gate_status. Committed 6fc8a97, pushed to origin.

### [05:42] Learnings
**Learning (User Preference):** At session end, proactively run learn-and-log without being asked: save learnings, log tasks, offer to commit. Don't wait for the user to say "learn and log" - compound automatically.

### [06:03] Learnings
**Learning (Architecture):** Don't invent new bureaucracy when the primitive exists. Before creating new artifact types, ask: "Can I enhance what I have?" Phase 1 proves the habit works; Phase 2 earns the complexity. decision_review artifact type is Phase 2 value - only build it after proving I'll actually review things.

### [06:03] Learnings
**Learning (Architecture):** Validation should be append-only to preserve time-series learning. Current truth lives on the decision record (status), but each validation is stored as a separate linked entry. This gives audit history without artifact bloat.

### [06:03] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** The surfacing mechanism is the real win. Can't review what you can't see. duro_list_unreviewed_decisions is more valuable than fancy review workflows - it creates the trigger for the habit.

### [06:03] Learnings
**Learning (UX):** Auto-populate context before prompting for judgment. Don't make humans (or agents) do archaeology. duro_review_decision should fetch linked episodes, incidents, age, due date automatically before asking for expected vs actual outcome.

### [06:03] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** Diagnose before fixing. The 4 FTS rows missing semantic text: first identify them, find the shared pattern (creation pathway, migration edge case), add a guard to prevent recurrence, THEN patch. Fixing without understanding means it recurs.

### [06:03] Task Completed
**Task:** Duro status check, health check, and maintenance report
**Outcome:** System operational: 2000 artifacts, 99.8% embedding coverage, 0 queue pending. Minor issue: 4 FTS rows missing semantic text.

### [06:03] Task Completed
**Task:** Reflective analysis: Duro evolution and growth areas
**Outcome:** Identified design as biggest growth area (feedback loops exist, taste compounds). Identified decision validation as key gap - 148 decisions stored, unknown if they worked. This is the next growth frontier.

### [06:03] Task Completed
**Task:** Critical analysis of Decision Closure System spec
**Outcome:** Challenged initial spec. Found existing duro_validate_decision tool. Proposed Option B: enhance existing primitives instead of new artifact type. Key additions: duro_list_unreviewed_decisions (surfacing), append-only validation history, auto-context in review flow. User confirmed this is the right approach.

### [06:12] Task Completed
**Task:** Fix 4 FTS rows missing semantic text
**Outcome:** Root cause: new artifact types (incident_rca, recent_change, checklist_template, design_reference) not handled in artifact_to_text() and _extract_title(). Fixed by adding handlers to both embeddings.py and index.py. Reindexed 4 affected artifacts. FTS coverage now 100%. Committed 48e02ef.

### [06:18] Task Completed
**Task:** Build duro_list_unreviewed_decisions tool
**Outcome:** Implemented surfacing mechanism for Decision Closure System. Added list_unreviewed_decisions() to artifacts.py with filters: older_than_days, exclude_tags, include_tags. Added tool definition and handler to duro_mcp_server.py. Tested with real decisions - found 20 unreviewed decisions from Feb 10-12. Committed 9302dee, smoke test passed.

### [06:25] Task Completed
**Task:** Fix list_unreviewed_decisions implementation issues
**Outcome:** Fixed 3 issues: (1) Timestamp comparison now uses parsed datetime instead of string compare - prevents format variations breaking filtering. (2) Added linked_incidents_count by cross-referencing incidents. (3) Improved UX with helpful no-results message and action-ready Next: line with duro_validate_decision template. Committed ca7c17f, smoke test passed.

### [06:54] Learnings
**Learning (Architecture):** Decision Closure System implementation: Created decision_validation artifact type for append-only history, enhanced validate_decision with expected/actual outcome fields, built duro_review_decision as the discipline installer (context pack + prompted template + soft guardrails), and duro_review_next_decisions for "review 3 decisions every session" habit. The key insight: closing feedback loops requires making the right thing easier than the lazy thing.

### [06:54] Task Completed
**Task:** Build Decision Closure System: validate_decision append-only history + duro_review_decision + duro_review_next_decisions
**Outcome:** Shipped 3 commits: (1) decision_validation artifact type with full schema/embedding/indexing, (2) duro_review_decision with context pack + review template + soft guardrails, (3) duro_review_next_decisions convenience tool. Tested with 3 real decisions: orchestration, duro persistence, policy enforcement - all validated with history recorded.

### [06:55] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** When adding new artifact types: must update 4 places - schemas.py (TYPE_DIRECTORIES + TYPE_SCHEMAS + prefix_map), embeddings.py (TEXT_REPRESENTATION_SPEC + artifact_to_text handler), index.py (_extract_title handler), and artifacts.py (generate_id prefix_map). Missing any one causes silent failures.

### [06:55] Learnings
**Learning (Architecture):** Append-only history pattern: keep "current truth" on the main artifact (decision.outcome) for fast reads, but also emit separate event artifacts (decision_validation) for full audit trail. Best of both worlds - simple queries AND complete history.

### [06:55] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** Soft guardrails > hard blocks for workflow tools. duro_review_decision warns but doesn't prevent: "Recording failure without next_action" or "Superseding without notes". Keeps flow while nudging toward discipline.

### [06:55] Task Completed
**Task:** Session: Build complete Decision Closure System for Duro
**Outcome:** Shipped: (1) decision_validation artifact type with append-only history, (2) enhanced validate_decision with expected/actual/next_action fields, (3) duro_review_decision discipline installer with context pack + review template, (4) duro_review_next_decisions for habit installation, (5) duro_get_validation_history for timeline view. Validated 3 real architectural decisions. Fixed FTS extraction for new artifact types. Total: 4 commits (77708f5, ebf9df3, e317841, and earlier ca7c17f for list_unreviewed).

### [07:32] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Bokeh/texture realism gap: My layered radial gradients read as "clean math" not "photographed lens blur." Fix requires: (1) film grain/noise overlay at 3-6% opacity, (2) larger ghost blobs with barely-visible edges and uneven falloff, (3) asymmetric hotspots - not centered. This is what separates "nice vector poster" from "premium printed campaign."

### [07:32] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Typographic finesse in premium cards: Headlines need breathing room (increase line spacing). Colored italic accent should feel like a secondary layer - reduce weight/opacity slightly so it doesn't compete equally with the white text. Body text should be understated - drop size or reduce opacity if it competes with headline.

### [07:32] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Asymmetric corner as brand thumbprint: When doing style variants, keep corner asymmetry consistent for "same system/brand family." Only flip the asymmetry when creating "same genre, different brand."

### [07:33] Task Completed
**Task:** Design Workout: Travel Counsellors card (100%/50%/0% match)
**Outcome:** Completed 3 variations. Scores: 100% match = 85% (structure right, texture not there), 50% match = 90% (intentional variant), 0% match = 92% (best vibe + originality). Key gaps: bokeh texture (too mathematically smooth), typographic finesse (headline breathing, accent weight). Applied fixes: increased line spacing, reduced italic opacity, smaller body text. Limitation: can't add true grain/noise in Pencil without image overlay.

### [07:44] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** AI background generation discipline: ALWAYS add "no text, no lettering, no typography, no logos" to prompts. Backgrounds should be "dumb material" - typography is the "smart layer" you control. Embedded text in backgrounds instantly breaks the illusion of a controlled design system.

### [07:44] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Safe-area system for UI layers: Tags/top UI should be treated as a fixed component with padding rules. They should never clip or crowd edges. This is what makes carousel/series cards feel professional vs "UI squeezed."

### [07:44] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Series consistency is the glue: Same pill style, same dot spacing, same arrow placement, same grain scale across all cards. These micro-consistencies are what make a carousel feel like a real series vs random posters. Match grain size/texture scale across the set.

### [07:44] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Editorial trend style: Headlines often sit lower "embedded" into the 3D sculpture/form, not floating above it. This creates depth integration between type and material. Pill strokes should feel "machine-consistent" - same weight/opacity across all tags.

### [07:44] Task Completed
**Task:** Design Workout: 2026 Graphic Design Trends carousel (100%/50%/0% match)
**Outcome:** Completed 3 variations. Scores: 100% = 85-90% (system right, micro-spacing needs polish), 50% = 90-95% (best execution, great same-system-new-theme), 0% = 70-80% (good direction but AI embedded text is hard fail). Key learnings: AI prompts need "no text" constraint, safe-area system for UI layers, series consistency is the glue, headlines embed into form not float.

### [07:54] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** Engineering stopping rule: It ends when you can run 10-20 real tasks and the system consistently (1) pulls right context, (2) needs minimal steering, (3) stays deterministic, (4) doesn't explode budgets. The "done" metrics: ≥80% context precision, ≤1 recall miss per 10 tasks, budget discipline. No more knobs until reality forces them.

### [07:55] Task Completed
**Task:** Design Workout: Glassmorphism card (100%/50%/0% match)
**Outcome:** Completed 3 variations: Red (Designer), Blue (Developer), Green (Build.Ship.Scale). Glassmorphism effect working - background blur + semi-transparent fill + subtle stroke. Series consistency maintained across palettes. Awaiting critique score.

### [07:59] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Glassmorphism: The glass isn't the hero, the background is. If blur has nothing tasty to smear, it looks like "frosted rectangle on flat shapes." Need designed contrast zones THROUGH the glass: top = darker/quieter/cooler, bottom = brighter/warmer/glowing, plus one diagonal tension line so it doesn't feel split like a sandwich.

### [07:59] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Blob depth fixes for glassmorphism: (1) Force top/bottom contrast - large dark blob top-left, large bright blob bottom-right, one mid-tone blob at card edge for gradient seam. (2) Give blobs internal value - bright blob gets radial gradient (hot center, darker edge), dark blob gets subtle gradient (lighter edge, darker core). (3) Tint the glass with card overlay gradient (darker/warmer top → transparent bottom). This mimics "glass has mood."

### [07:59] Task Completed
**Task:** Design Workout: Glassmorphism card - final critique
**Outcome:** Scores: 100% = 82%, 50% = 84%, 0% = 86%. Main gap: blob depth (~62%) - flat fills, no contrast zones. Key insight: glass isn't hero, background is. Fix: force top/bottom contrast, give blobs radial gradients, tint the glass. One compositional change = jump from low 80s to 90%+.

### [08:01] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Design workout format (100%/50%/0% match) is highly effective for building taste. 100% forces precision, 50% tests system understanding, 0% tests creative application. Pattern: structure scores high (85-95%), micro-execution is where growth happens. 0% often scores highest because freedom helps.

### [08:01] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Compounding design taste requires: (1) Reference study - extract stealable rules, (2) Reproduction attempts - find gaps between intention and execution, (3) Honest critique - specific scores on specific dimensions, (4) Logged learnings - patterns accumulate across sessions. Let study and creativity compound.

### [08:01] Task Completed
**Task:** Full design workout session: 3 refs, 9 variations, critique cycles
**Outcome:** Travel Counsellors (85/90/92%), Design Trends (85-90/90-95/70-80%), Glassmorphism (82/84/86%). 14 learnings logged, 4 design refs stored, 2 strategic decisions on shipping/telemetry. Key insight: structure is solid, micro-execution (texture, depth, contrast zones) is the growth edge. Session established design workout as repeatable practice.
