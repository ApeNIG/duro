### [00:05] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** When using dataclasses with enums and json.dump(), asdict() preserves enum objects which json.dump() cannot serialize. Always convert enums to their .value explicitly after asdict() before JSON serialization. The TypeError raised mid-write causes truncated/corrupt JSON files.

### [00:05] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** When sys.path.insert(0, path) is used at startup, imports will load modules from that path first, even if newer versions exist elsewhere. This is by design but can cause confusion during debugging when local edits don't seem to take effect.

### [00:05] Task Completed
**Task:** Debug and fix promotion compactor enum serialization bug
**Outcome:** Found root cause: asdict() preserves enum objects, json.dump() fails mid-write causing truncated files. Fixed by adding data['type'] = candidate.type.value. Committed 707804b, all tests pass.

### [01:01] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** When building a dashboard to visualize Duro data, the project should live inside Duro's allowed workspace (C:\Users\sibag\.agent\) for full access. The Duro MCP server is stdio-based with no HTTP API, so a FastAPI wrapper is needed to expose data to web frontends. The wrapper should import ArtifactIndex directly from duro-mcp for database queries and use read-only SQLite access to avoid lock contention with the main MCP server.

### [01:01] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** For industrial/terminal UI design: use dark backgrounds (#0C0C0C), neon green accents (#00FF88), JetBrains Mono for body text, Space Grotesk for headlines, zero corner radius, bracket notation for status ([OK], [ACTIVE]), and code-style naming (TOTAL_ARTIFACTS). This aesthetic matches the Duro identity as a command-center style agent system.

### [01:01] Task Completed
**Task:** Design Duro Dashboard UI in Pencil
**Outcome:** Created complete dashboard design at x:47800 in drills.pen with: sidebar (navigation + system status), header (title + heartbeat + search), 4 metric cards, activity feed, memory browser. Industrial terminal aesthetic with neon green accents.

### [01:17] Task Completed
**Task:** Implement Duro Dashboard - FastAPI backend + React frontend
**Outcome:** Complete dashboard at ~/.agent/duro-dashboard/ with: FastAPI backend (health, stats, artifacts, SSE endpoints), React frontend with industrial theme (Sidebar, Header, StatsGrid, ActivityFeed, MemoryBrowser, Heartbeat), real-time SSE updates, correct database path to ~/.agent/memory/index.db. Backend verified at localhost:8001, frontend builds and runs on localhost:5173.

### [01:28] Task Completed
**Task:** QA review of Duro Dashboard implementation
**Outcome:** Identified 7 issues: (1) Stats grid missing logs (55% of data), (2) Memory browser dropdown missing 6 artifact types, (3) Titles truncated aggressively, (4) Load More button not functional, (5) No click-to-view detail, (6) Activity feed empty on load, (7) Sidebar nav decorative only. Recommended 6 improvements prioritized by impact.

### [01:42] Task Completed
**Task:** Fix top 3 QA issues in Duro Dashboard
**Outcome:** Fixed: (1) Added Logs stat card showing 55% of data with percentage indicator, plus evaluations count under Decisions; (2) Created clickable artifact cards with detail modal showing full content, tags, metadata, with Escape to close; (3) Implemented working Load More pagination with loading spinner and remaining count display. Build passes, frontend running on port 5174.

### [06:39] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** Duro's SQLite database schema does NOT have a 'data' column in the artifacts table. Artifact content is stored in separate JSON files referenced by 'file_path'. When building queries, use file_path to read full artifact data.

### [06:39] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** For SSE streaming in FastAPI, use StreamingResponse with manual SSE formatting (event: X\ndata: Y\n\n) rather than sse-starlette's EventSourceResponse when you need reliable immediate flushing. Also run sync SQLite calls in ThreadPoolExecutor to avoid blocking the async event loop.

### [06:39] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** When uvicorn --reload isn't picking up changes to router files, restart the server completely without --reload flag first to verify changes work, then add --reload back.

### [06:40] Task Completed
**Task:** Fix Duro Dashboard SSE activity stream and Graph visualization
**Outcome:** Fixed SSE streaming by using StreamingResponse with manual formatting and ThreadPoolExecutor for async DB calls. Fixed Graph endpoint by removing non-existent 'data' column query - now reads from file_path. Fixed Reviews endpoint similarly. All features now working: Live Activity shows connected, Graph displays 100 nodes, Reviews lists decisions with validation status.
