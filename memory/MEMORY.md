## Design Workflow

### Process (Hard Rule)
1. **Planify** - Plan project comprehensively first
2. **Two Directions** - Create 2 contrasting design directions in Pencil
3. **Self-Evaluate** - Score on 8 criteria (no user approval needed)
4. **Blend** - Take best elements from each into final design
5. **Implement** - Code the final blended design

### Design Preferences
- Sports apps: "playful_sports" vs "minimal_clean" directions
- SaaS dashboards: "minimal_clean" vs "dark_premium" directions
- Mobile-first responsive approach
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Accessibility matters (contrast, sizing)

### Tools
- **Pencil MCP** - For all mockups (.pen files)
- **Planify** - For project planning before design
- **Screenshot** - To validate visual output

## Learned Patterns

### What Works
- Playwright for JS-rendered sites (Rightmove, Zoopla)
- Pre-researched area scores better than live research each time
- Markdown files for persistence
- Task scheduler for automation
- PowerShell for Windows commands in Claude Code

### What to Avoid
- Raw shell commands without guardrails
- Storing credentials in code
- Over-engineering simple solutions
- Git Bash path mangling on Windows

## Important Context
- Built "Duro" - personal agent orchestration system
- Wants orchestration across multiple projects
- Values local-first, owns-their-data approach
