# Memory Log - 2026-02-16

### [06:53] Task Completed
**Task:** Add ComfyUI backend to Duro image_generate.py skill
**Outcome:** Successfully added ComfyUI as new backend option. Changes: (1) SDK import with graceful fallback, (2) COMFYUI enum value, (3) ComfyUI config entries (base_url, api_key_env, timeout, poll_interval, steps, cfg_scale, sampler), (4) generate_comfyui handler with full error handling, (5) Handler registered in BACKEND_HANDLERS, (6) Default fallback order: Pollinations -> ComfyUI -> DALL-E -> Stock, (7) SKILL_META bumped to v1.1.0 with 600s timeout

### [07:25] Task Completed
**Task:** Add production-quality AI generation backends (Flux, Kling, Minimax) and cost estimator
**Outcome:** Successfully implemented: (1) Flux via FAL.ai backend for image_generate.py (~$0.04/image, excellent quality), (2) video_generate.py skill with Minimax/Hailuo (~$0.27/6s) and Kling AI (~$0.30/5s) backends, (3) production_cost_estimator.py for calculating costs before jobs run. Updated skills/index.json with all new skills.

### [07:27] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** For production-quality AI generation on a budget: Flux via FAL.ai ($0.04/image) matches DALL-E quality at same cost but faster. Minimax/Hailuo ($0.27/6s video) has free tier and is 50% cheaper than Runway. Kling AI ($0.30/5s) offers best motion quality. Always build a cost estimator skill when adding paid backends - users need to validate budgets before running jobs.

### [07:27] Learnings
**Learning (User Preference):** When user has hardware limitations (can't run local AI models) and cost constraints (RunPod too expensive), focus on: (1) Free tiers first (Pollinations, Minimax free), (2) Per-use APIs over subscriptions for low volume, (3) Cost comparison tools to find optimal backends per job.

### [07:27] Task Completed
**Task:** Session: Add production-quality AI backends to Duro skills
**Outcome:** Completed full implementation: (1) ComfyUI backend for image_generate.py, (2) Flux via FAL.ai backend, (3) video_generate.py with Minimax/Hailuo + Kling AI, (4) production_cost_estimator.py for budget planning. Two commits pushed: 838a1db (ComfyUI) and 44972b3 (Flux, video gen, cost estimator). User now has professional-grade generation stack at ~$2-3 per typical production.

### [07:55] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** Design workflow for alabi-portfolio and similar projects: ALWAYS use Pencil.dev to create mockups first, evaluate them visually, iterate on what's working, and only then implement in code. This allows for faster iteration and better design outcomes. Never skip the mockup phase.

### [07:55] Learnings
**Learning (User Preference):** Never assume or make up personal information like names. If a name or personal detail isn't explicitly provided, ask the user. Names are critical - getting them wrong is unacceptable. User's name: Alabi Ibagun.

### [07:59] Learnings
**Learning (Process):** Design workflow (corrected): 1) Open Pencil.dev, 2) Create mockup variations, 3) In autonomous mode: rate your own work and self-critique (this builds better judgment), 4) Iterate on the design based on self-evaluation, 5) Only then implement in code. Self-rating develops stronger creative instincts.

### [08:19] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Swiss Clean design system for SaaS dashboards: Zero corner radius, single red accent (#E42313), Space Grotesk for headings + Inter for body, #0D0D0D soft black for text, #E8E8E8 borders, generous spacing. Geometric logo marks, red dot indicators for active nav states.

### [08:19] Task Completed
**Task:** Redesigned seto-rota application with Swiss Clean design system
**Outcome:** Created Pencil.dev mockups (Login + Dashboard), self-rated and iterated designs to 8.5/10, then implemented: globals.css design tokens, split-screen auth layout, Swiss Clean login form, geometric sidebar with red active indicators, design-tokens.ts utility. Full workflow: mockup → critique → iterate → implement.

### [13:13] Task Completed
**Task:** Set up remote Claude access via Telegram with Duro memory
**Outcome:** Successfully deployed Claude Telegram bot on DigitalOcean droplet ($6/month). Features: 24/7 availability, Duro memory integration, voice note transcription with Whisper AI, Notion/Vercel MCP access. User can now chat with Claude from phone with full context and memory. Server: 165.22.115.170

### [13:13] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** Claude Code's -p (print) mode requires --allowedTools flag to auto-approve MCP tools. Without it, MCP tools like Duro require interactive permission approval which doesn't work in non-interactive mode.

### [13:13] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** To add local MCP servers to Claude Code, use 'claude mcp add <name> <command> <args>' - this writes to .claude.json project config. Settings in ~/.claude/settings.json may not be loaded the same way.

### [13:14] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** For Telegram bots with voice support: Use faster-whisper (tiny model) for efficient transcription on low-RAM servers. Telegram sends voice as .ogg files. Bot workflow: download voice -> transcribe with Whisper -> send to Claude -> return response.

### [13:31] Task Completed
**Task:** Set up Git-based memory sync between local Windows machine and DigitalOcean server
**Outcome:** Successfully configured bidirectional git sync for .agent memory repo. Created sync scripts for both machines. Fixed SQLite database conflicts by excluding .db files from git tracking. Server has hourly cron job, local has manual push/pull scripts.

### [13:32] Task Completed
**Task:** Fix Duro logging - artifact store was never being called
**Outcome:** Added artifact_store.store_log() calls to all 4 logging handlers (save_memory, save_learning, log_task, log_failure)

### [13:34] Task Completed
**Task:** Test logging after fix
**Outcome:** Verifying artifact store is now being called

### [13:36] Test Log
Test log entry - verifying logging works correctly after artifact store fix.

### [13:36] Task Completed
**Task:** Test logging functionality
**Outcome:** Both save_memory and log_task working correctly

### [13:37] Task Completed
**Task:** Session: Quick logging verification
**Outcome:** Confirmed both save_memory and log_task functions working correctly after earlier artifact store fix.

### [13:57] Task Completed
**Task:** Add max_chars truncation to duro_query_archive
**Outcome:** Fixed large MCP response warning. Default 4000 chars, use max_chars=0 for full. Commit 9989779 pushed to duro-mcp.

### [14:08] Task Completed
**Task:** Comprehensive Duro production readiness check
**Outcome:** All core systems operational. Fixed 2 bugs: (1) rules.py key mismatch - now shows 13 rules instead of 0, (2) duro_query_archive truncation - prevents context overflow. 35/35 enforcement tests pass, 7/7 smoke tests pass. 11 evals need skill_path (workflow evals, not blockers). System is production-ready.

### [14:17] Task Completed
**Task:** Add logging safeguards to prevent silent failures
**Outcome:** Added return value checking to all 4 logging handlers + warning logs on failure + TEST 8 in smoke suite to catch regressions. Commit bf211ea pushed.

### [16:16] Task Completed
**Task:** System check and hookify optimization
**Outcome:** Diagnosed hook hangs caused by hookify plugin. Disabled plugin, merged 7 .local.md rules into enforcement_patterns.json v2.0 (11 hard rules). Deleted redundant files. System now lean and fast with same protection level.

### [16:17] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** Hookify plugin with 4 hook entry points (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Stop) spawns Python subprocesses on every tool call, causing potential hangs. The leaner approach is enforcement_patterns.json loaded directly by pretooluse.py - same protection, no subprocess overhead per hook type.

### [16:17] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** 54.2% embedding coverage is expected and healthy when most missing embeddings are log entries. Logs don't need semantic search - they're task records, not searchable knowledge. Only facts, decisions, and episodes need embeddings.

### [16:17] Learnings
**Learning (Architecture):** When consolidating rule systems, merge patterns into a single enforcement_patterns.json rather than running multiple rule evaluation systems. Single source of truth, faster execution, easier debugging.

### [17:30] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Creative Direction Framework: Use Double Diamond (Discover→Define→Develop→Deliver) for original work. Key techniques: 1) Start with constraints not blank canvas, 2) Research deeply before ideating, 3) Generate 10+ concepts before refining, 4) Use SCAMPER (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse), 5) Avoid first-instinct solutions - they're usually generic. Red flags for generic design: stock photo vibes, safe color choices, predictable layouts, lack of intentional tension.

### [17:30] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Brand Expression System: 12 Jungian Archetypes (Innocent, Explorer, Sage, Hero, Outlaw, Magician, Regular Guy, Lover, Jester, Caregiver, Creator, Ruler) + Aaker's 5 Dimensions (Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication, Ruggedness). Visual language mapping: Color psychology (blue=trust, red=energy, black=luxury), Typography personality (serif=traditional/trustworthy, sans=modern/clean, display=expressive), Shape language (circles=friendly, squares=stable, triangles=dynamic). Brand coherence requires consistent application across all touchpoints.

### [17:30] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Design Trends 2024-2026: Contemporary patterns - Glassmorphism 2.0 (frosted glass with subtle gradients), Bento Grids (asymmetric card layouts), Variable Fonts (weight/width animation), Mesh Gradients, 3D elements with depth, Micro-interactions. Dated patterns to avoid: flat material design, hamburger menus on desktop, generic stock imagery, overly minimal "startup" aesthetic, pure white backgrounds (#fff), perfect geometric shapes without variation. Trend application: Use sparingly as accents, not wholesale adoption.

### [17:30] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Emotional Design (Don Norman's 3 Levels): 1) Visceral - immediate aesthetic reaction (colors, shapes, first impression), 2) Behavioral - usability and function pleasure (smooth interactions, predictable responses), 3) Reflective - meaning and self-image (what using this says about me). Premium feel markers: generous whitespace, refined typography hierarchy, subtle shadows with blur, deliberate color restraint, micro-animations with easing. Cheap feel markers: cramped layouts, inconsistent spacing, too many colors, harsh shadows, abrupt transitions. Trust signals: consistent visual language, professional photography, clear hierarchy, appropriate density.

### [17:30] Task Completed
**Task:** Design skills research - Creative direction, brand expression, trends, and emotional design
**Outcome:** Completed comprehensive research across 4 areas. Logged key frameworks: Double Diamond + SCAMPER for creative direction, 12 Archetypes + Aaker's 5 Dimensions for brand expression, 2024-2026 trend patterns (Glassmorphism 2.0, Bento Grids, Variable Fonts) vs dated patterns, Norman's 3 Levels of emotional design with premium vs cheap markers.

### [17:34] Learnings
**Learning (User Preference):** User preference: Focus on web/desktop designs rather than mobile-first. User doesn't typically work with mobile interfaces - prioritize dashboard layouts, web apps, landing pages, and desktop components.

### [17:38] Learnings
**Learning (Design Process):** Design exercise workflow: When creating multiple designs, batch efficiently (2-3 designs per batch_design call with ~25 operations). Start by getting style guides for different aesthetics, then systematically apply them. Spread designs on canvas with 100-200px gaps minimum to avoid cramped appearance.

### [17:38] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Style-to-archetype mapping for rapid design: Zen/Calm = Caregiver archetype (soft colors, generous whitespace, Sora/IBM Plex Mono). Fintech/Crypto = Outlaw archetype (dark mode, neon lime #BFFF00, sharp corners, JetBrains Mono). Luxury = Ruler archetype (gold #C9A962, Cormorant Garamond serif, deep black #0A0A0A). Kids/Playful = Innocent archetype (coral #FF6B6B, rounded corners 16-20px, Bricolage Grotesque). Sustainable/Organic = Creator archetype (terracotta #C67A52, warm cream #FAF8F4, IBM Plex Sans).

### [17:38] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Font pairing patterns that work: (1) Sora + IBM Plex Mono = Japanese-Swiss minimal, (2) Inter + JetBrains Mono = Terminal/industrial dark, (3) Cormorant Garamond + Inter = Luxury elegant, (4) Bricolage Grotesque + DM Sans = Playful friendly, (5) IBM Plex Sans solo = Warm humanist organic. Use negative letter-spacing (-1 to -3px) on large headlines for premium density.

### [17:38] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Color accent rules by mood: Single accent discipline creates stronger brand identity. Red #DC2626 = action/energy (CTAs, alerts). Lime #BFFF00 = tech/data/positive metrics. Gold #C9A962 = luxury/premium (use with deep black). Terracotta #C67A52 = organic/sustainable/warm. Coral #FF6B6B = playful/friendly/youthful. Always pair accent with appropriate neutral palette (warm cream for organic, pure black for luxury/tech).

### [17:38] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Component patterns that recur across designs: (1) Stat cards with label/value/change indicator, (2) Section headers with title + optional badge/link, (3) Progress bars with track + fill, (4) Tag/badge pills for status, (5) Price display with large value + small period suffix. These patterns work across all style systems - just swap colors/fonts/radius.

### [17:38] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Corner radius as personality signal: 0px = premium/luxury/architectural/serious (luxury hotel, pricing). 8-16px = professional/approachable (SaaS, dashboards). 16-24px = friendly/playful/consumer (kids apps, lifestyle). Full circular = maximum friendliness (avatars, day indicators). Consistency within a design is more important than the specific value.

### [17:38] Task Completed
**Task:** Created 10 diverse web designs applying design research frameworks
**Outcome:** Successfully created: (1) Meditation app - zen minimal, (2) Crypto dashboard - dark neon, (3) Sustainable fashion card - earthy warm, (4) Kids learning app - playful colorful, (5) Luxury hotel card - gold elegant, (6) Fitness tracker widget - bold industrial, (7) Podcast player - minimal dark, (8) Recipe card - warm organic, (9) SaaS pricing section - clean professional, (10) Music festival hero - vibrant bold. Applied brand archetypes, emotional design levels, and current trends. User feedback: prefer web/desktop over mobile designs.

### [17:49] Learnings
**Learning (Design Process):** Design drill exercises (Hero Drill 20, Card Drill 30) showed discipline but prioritized quantity over intentional variation. Most variations were too similar (same dark bg + accent color, text resizing rather than conceptual shifts). Future drills should enforce radical divergence between variations - change layout structure, color scheme, AND typography approach for each variation.

### [17:49] Learnings
**Learning (Design Skills):** Dark UI themes are a comfort zone - most confident work uses dark backgrounds. Light themes exist but feel less polished. To grow: deliberately practice light theme designs with same rigor as dark. The Lore CRM V5 (light, "Good Morning Marcus") proved light can be warm and professional.

### [17:49] Learnings
**Learning (Design Skills):** Functional UX strength confirmed - layouts make sense, hierarchy is clear, information architecture is solid across all dashboard designs (Lore CRM, MSJ Swimmer, Seto-Rota). This is a reliable skill. Weakness is in visual delight and emotional resonance - designs are competent but rarely delightful.

### [17:49] Learnings
**Learning (Design Skills):** The Malawi Birthday Postcard (9/10) proves emotional design capability exists when applied. Key elements: warm color palette (cream, coral, teal), script + sans typography pairing, small decorative elements (stars, hearts, flowers) adding charm without clutter. This emotional layer is missing from most functional UI work - need to bring this sensibility to dashboards and apps.

### [17:49] Learnings
**Learning (Design Reference):** Best designs from review: 1) Malawi Birthday Postcard (emotional warmth), 2) Seto-Rota Planner (functional excellence with color-coded shifts, scannable grid), 3) Lore CRM V6 Bento Layout (bold asymmetric departure from grid, gradient cards adding warmth). Common thread: they took creative risks rather than playing safe.

### [17:49] Learnings
**Learning (Design Process):** CRM dashboard iterations (V1-V6) showed real growth trajectory. V1-V2 were similar dark themes. V5 introduced personalization ("Good Morning, Marcus") and warmth. V6 broke the grid with bento/card layout. Lesson: iteration works when each version challenges a previous assumption, not just tweaks details.

### [17:49] Task Completed
**Task:** Comprehensive review of all designs on Pencil board (50+ designs across Foundations drills, Lore CRM iterations, real project mockups, landing pages, and new designs)
**Outcome:** Scored and critiqued all major design sections. Identified patterns: dark theme comfort zone, strong functional UX, inconsistent visual delight. Top designs: Malawi Birthday Postcard (9/10), Seto-Rota Planner (8.5/10), Lore CRM V6 (8.5/10). Logged 6 learnings for compounding.

### [18:03] Learnings
**Learning (Design Process):** Redesigning work reveals comfort patterns: even when "applying learnings", designs stayed safe with conventional layouts (card + image + text + CTA). True improvement requires breaking structure, not just improving execution within it. The 10 redesigns were polished but predictable - warm colors and nice typography don't equal creative risk.

### [18:03] Learnings
**Learning (Design Philosophy):** User feedback: "You are playing it too safe." Design knowledge can become a cage - knowing the rules creates fear of breaking them. The best designs often violate conventions intentionally. Next level requires: asymmetry that feels wrong, color combinations that clash productively, typography that breaks grids, layouts that create tension.

### [18:03] Task Completed
**Task:** Redesigned 10 components with learnings applied (warm themes, light modes, better typography)
**Outcome:** All 10 completed with fixes for spacing/alignment. User feedback: too safe, need to push creative boundaries and break conventions.

### [18:44] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Design review session revealed: The gap between concept-work (Dribbble) and product-work (shippable) is the gap between 7/10 and 8.5/10. Shippable work scores higher because it solves real problems, not just looks good.

### [18:44] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** One clever integration beats ten decorative elements. Examples: bar chart as letter in "dominates", sunglasses becoming the "o", AI chat replacing booking forms. Find the ONE detail that shows thinking.

### [18:44] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Confident design knows what to leave out. Anxious design fills every gap. The cluttered portfolio (5/10) vs minimal car rental (8.5/10) - restraint is a skill, not a limitation.

### [18:44] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Full color commitment creates identity. Monochromatic palettes (all blue, all cream) show discipline and become memorable. You can't hide when you commit to a constraint.

### [18:44] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Warm palettes differentiate in a cold blue/grey software world. Homies Lab HR dashboard used cream/yellow and felt human. Default corporate colors are a missed opportunity.

### [18:44] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Typography as structure > typography as decoration. When type becomes architecture (tunnel perspective, triangle grid, letters as walls), it's memorable. When type just labels, it's forgettable.

### [18:44] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** My experimental designs were aesthetic exercises, not problem-solving. "Brutalist" and "anti-design" are known styles - I was recombining patterns, not creating. Real creativity requires asking: who uses this and why?

### [18:45] Task Completed
**Task:** Reviewed 14 external designs with honest critique, synthesized patterns, extracted 7 key learnings for future creative work
**Outcome:** Identified gap between concept-work (6.5-7.5) and product-work (8-8.5). Key insights: one clever detail > decoration, confidence = restraint, warm palettes differentiate, typography as structure, solve problems not aesthetics.

### [19:00] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Breakthrough session: Created 5 designs (D1-D5) that received positive feedback by asking "what does this need to DO" before "what would look cool." Problem-first thinking > aesthetic-first thinking. This is the direction to keep developing.

### [19:00] Learnings
**Learning (Design):** Copy is design. "Neon lights, crossing chaos" carries as much weight as typography choices. The words matter - poetic descriptions > functional descriptions. "The smell that gets everyone out of bed" > "Ingredients: flour, eggs, butter"

### [19:00] Task Completed
**Task:** Created 5 problem-first designs: Event Ticket, Recipe Moment, Album Drop, Fitness Achievement, Travel Itinerary
**Outcome:** Received positive feedback - "stepped up your design game" and "keep going this direction you will have a style and look." Each design had one clever integration, warm/intentional palettes, restrained execution.

### [19:02] Design Session Summary
## Design Session - Feb 16, 2026

### Arc of the Session:
1. Started by reviewing ALL designs on board - gave honest scores (avg 7/10)
2. Created X-series "experimental" designs - admitted they were "safe experimental"
3. Tried to make something "uncomfortable" - learned I can't truly break my patterns
4. User challenged: "Never lie to yourself or me. NEVER!"
5. Reviewed 14 external designs - learned what separates good from great
6. Created D-series (D1-D5) with problem-first thinking - received positive feedback

### External Designs Reviewed:
- Travel Counsellors: 6/10 - safe, forgettable

### My D-Series Created:
- D1: Event Ticket - "11:55 PM" for midnight party
- D2: Recipe Moment - stacked circles = pancakes
- D3: Album Drop - dimmed "I" in "BEFORE I GO"
- D4: Fitness Win - green bar = completion
- D5: Travel Story - orange dot = "you are here"

### Key Breakthrough:
Problem-first > aesthetic-first. Ask "what does this need to DO" before "what would look cool."

### User Feedback:
"You have deffo stepped up your design game. Keep going this direction you will have a style and look."

### [20:41] Task Completed
**Task:** Phase 4.4 Synthetic Episode Test
**Outcome:** Full eval flow verified: episode → actions → close → evaluate → apply. Confidence reinforcement working (+0.01 delta). All systems operational.

### [20:51] Task Completed
**Task:** The Fashanus Episode 1 - Breakfast Silence storyboard
**Outcome:** Produced 6-panel storyboard in Pencil: Rachel's POV, ~75sec runtime. AI images for 4 panels, stock for 2 (API failures). VO script complete. Grade: B+. Next: build prompt templates for consistency.

### [21:24] Task Completed
**Task:** Produce The Fashanus Episode 1 video from storyboard
**Outcome:** Assembled 35-second video (1080x1920) with 6 Unsplash images + 5 edge-tts voiceovers. Total cost: $0. Output: episode1_breakfast_silence.mp4 (1.9MB)

### [21:24] Learnings
**Learning (Technical):** Pencil stores AI-generated images at ~/.pencil/resources/<document-id>/images/generated-*.png - can access these directly for video production instead of using stock fallbacks
