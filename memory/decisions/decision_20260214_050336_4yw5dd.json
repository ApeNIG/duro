    "decision": "Restructure Cinematch using atomic design principles with route groups, component library, and services layer",
    "rationale": "Current codebase has organic growth issues: root clutter (15+ test files), no component hierarchy, scattered screenshots (6 folders), missing services layer. Restructure improves maintainability, testability, and developer experience.",
    "alternatives": [
      "Incremental cleanup only (less disruptive)",
      "Monorepo split into packages (overkill for current scale)",
      "Keep current structure with documentation (doesn't solve root issues)"
