    "decision": "Redesign Cinematch homepage with fresh creative direction while maintaining brand tokens",
    "rationale": "Current homepage has 8 sections with standard layout. User requested completely new design while following existing brand guidelines (void/obsidian dark theme, gold/teal accents, Inter/Playfair fonts). Opportunity to create more distinctive, emotionally resonant experience that better captures the cinematic nature of film-music collaboration.",

      "Complete brand overhaul including new colors",
      "Incremental section-by-section updates"
    ],
    "context": "Cinematch is a platform connecting filmmakers with composers. Target audience: directors, producers, music supervisors. Competitors: Scorefolio, traditional talent agencies. Value prop: curated profiles, search by vibe, direct messaging.",
