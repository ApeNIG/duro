    "decision": "Completed V4 Duro Homepage design for Cinematch with Dark Luxury aesthetic",
    "rationale": "Created a completely new homepage design following brand guidelines while introducing fresh creative direction. Applied Dark Luxury style guide principles: zero radius corners, gold-only accent, serif headlines, bordered containers. Design focuses on transformation narrative (\"Find the Sound That Elevates Your Story\") rather than feature-listing. Eight distinct sections create clear user journey from awareness to conversion.",
    "alternatives": [],
    "context": "Built in Pencil MCP tool. Used existing Cinematch brand tokens (void, obsidian, gold, teal). Designed for 1440px desktop width. All sections use consistent spacing (80px vertical padding, 56px horizontal) and typography scale (Playfair Display headlines, Inter body).",
