    "rationale": "Direction D scored 34/40 vs Direction C's 31/40. Deciding axis: \"Trust beats excitement\" - MSJ is a performance tracking tool where users need to trust their data. The elegant serif typography (Cormorant Garamond), gold accent highlights on achievements, and professional dark palette create a Garmin/Whoop-like experience that signals seriousness. Direction C's competition poster energy is valuable but overwhelming for daily use.",
