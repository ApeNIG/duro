    "rationale": "Precompiled renderings kill two problems at once: (1) token bloat from loading full skills when compact would suffice, (2) summarization drift from on-the-fly compression. Makes Context Assembler deterministic instead of vibes-based. Stats separated into skill_stats.json to avoid write amplification. Constraints field added for hard rules that must never be violated.",
