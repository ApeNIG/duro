Structure: north_star (statement + primary user job), laws (atomic rules with strength hard/soft, applies_to, provenance), constraints (do_not + accessibility), patterns_top (best practices), deciding_axes (meta-heuristics for taste), conflict_policy (order + tie_break). Promotion feeds into this: preferences become laws, tactics become patterns, procedural becomes skills.",
