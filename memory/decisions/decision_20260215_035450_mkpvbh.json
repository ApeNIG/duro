    "decision": "For MSJ progress dashboard, I built code directly without using Pencil first. This was efficient but missed learning opportunities.",
    "rationale": "The existing msj-directions.pen file already had 4 design directions (Playful Sports, Minimal Clean, Bold Vibrant, Dark Premium) and a Final design for the Home screen. The dual_direction_design skill provides a structured workflow for evaluating designs on 8 criteria. Building the Progress screen in Pencil first would have: 1) Generated reusable components, 2) Allowed visual iteration before code, 3) Created evaluation data for Duro to learn from, 4) Enabled design-to-code verification.",
