    "decision": "Extracted adversarial_planning pattern from SuperAGI and removed SuperAGI MCP",
    "rationale": "SuperAGI provided 13 tools that were mostly redundant with Claude Code built-ins (web search, file ops, shell). The only unique value was the Architect/Critic/Integrator planning pattern from planify_context. Extracted this as a standalone Duro skill (adversarial_planning.py) that generates structured planning prompts with built-in adversarial critique. Python execution was broken (timeouts), GitHub API unconfigured. Removing reduces tool clutter while preserving the valuable pattern.",
