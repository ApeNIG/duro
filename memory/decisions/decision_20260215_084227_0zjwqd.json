    "decision": "All future design work will be grounded in the Abstract-to-Digital Translation Framework: Apply the 10 core principles (Color Speaks, Negative Space, Process, Temperature, Scale, Rhythm, Balance, Direction, Depth, Harmony/Discord) consciously to every interface design. Start with emotional intent, select colors using Kandinsky mapping, then compose using Mondrian's structural wisdom.",
    "rationale": "Proven through systematic study of abstract art masters (Kandinsky, Mondrian, Malevich) and validation through 10 principle studies, 1 synthesis composition, and 5 production-ready designs spanning music, finance, meditation, e-commerce, and creative agency domains. Each design demonstrated that abstract principles translate directly to digital interfaces with measurable visual impact.",
