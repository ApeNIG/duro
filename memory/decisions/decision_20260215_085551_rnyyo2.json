    "decision": "All future design work will follow the DURO Design Operating System: Start with Intent (mood sentence + palette), then Composition (hierarchy + grid + intentional discord), then Behavior (motion with purpose). Use the 10-point runbook checklist. Apply the 6-point critique scorecard to evaluate. Never skip Layer 1 - if the mood/palette doesn't work, nothing else matters.",
    "rationale": "User elevated the Abstract-to-Digital framework into a complete operating system with three layers, a reusable runbook, and an objective scorecard. This transforms \"taste\" into trainable methodology. The cultural correction on color-emotion makes the framework more bulletproof.",
