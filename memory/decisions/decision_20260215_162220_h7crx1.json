Focus areas selected based on: (1) Verification skills have highest ROI - they validate AI outputs creating trust layer, (2) Video editing was explicitly deferred to 3.0, (3) Image generation has rules but no skill, (4) Code workflows are natural extension of design-to-code verifier.",

    ],
    "context": "Current state: 19 skills (15 core, 4 tested), 7 rules, 876 artifacts, 100% embedding coverage. Gaps: no image generation skill, no video skill, no code generation/review skill, limited multi-modal composition.",
