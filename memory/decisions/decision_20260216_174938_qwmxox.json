    "decision": "Future design practice should focus on: 1) Light theme confidence building, 2) Bringing emotional design sensibility (from birthday card) into functional UI, 3) Drills with enforced radical divergence between variations",
    "rationale": "Board review revealed dark themes as comfort zone, functional UX as strength, and emotional design as underutilized capability. The gap between birthday card quality (9/10) and average dashboard work (7/10) shows untapped potential.",
    "alternatives": [
      "Continue current drill approach (rejected - too safe)",
      "Focus only on more drills (rejected - quality over quantity needed)",
      "Abandon drills for real projects only (rejected - deliberate practice still valuable)"
