Build duro_list_unreviewed_decisions as surfacing mechanism. Add review_due_date only to architectural/strategic decisions.",
    "rationale": "Phase 1 proves the habit works; Phase 2 earns complexity. New artifact types create bureaucracy. Existing primitives (validate_decision, evaluations) give 80% of value. Surfacing mechanism is the real win - can't review what you can't see.",
