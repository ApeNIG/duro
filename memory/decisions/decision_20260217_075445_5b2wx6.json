Then freeze and ship features.",
    "rationale": "Engineering ends when next improvement stops buying real wins. Current skeleton (Gate, Amplifier, Bounded Expansion) is minimum viable. Third-order cleverness before paying \"does this help real tasks?\" debt = over-engineering. Standing at cliff edge now.",
