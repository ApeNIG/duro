    "decision": "Next phase is usage telemetry: log which injected skills were actually useful, then automatically promote expansions that get used, demote those that don't. This is how Duro becomes \"earned defaults\" not a fancy filing cabinet.",
    "rationale": "Without usage telemetry, the system is just static configuration. With it, the system learns per-project taste and the right context gets pulled automatically. The practical test: if Duro nails design drills with supporting skills auto-pulled, we're done.",
