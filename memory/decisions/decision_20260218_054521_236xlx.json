    "rationale": "Current state: autonomy engine works but doesn't truly learn. Decisions have 0 linked episodes (vibes-based reputation). Facts are 448 but mostly test spam (memory landfill). Rules are generic safety, no domain scars. Proactive recall is discipline-dependent (fragile). Need to turn engine into living system that produces trust.",
    "alternatives": [
      "Continue current path (test-only validation)",
      "Focus only on skill validation (easier but doesn't fix trust)",
      "Full rewrite of memory system (too disruptive)"
