    "decision": "Layer 6 capability system locked with four hard invariants: no hook → deny, wrong turn → deny, unbound token → deny, untrusted output → deny",
    "rationale": "These invariants form the core of capability security: authority originates from a human event (user message) and is not transferable across turns or to unbound tokens. Each invariant has a regression test that proves the gate slams shut. The system is now secure by invariant + proof, not just secure by vibes.",
    "alternatives": [
      "Softer checks with warnings (rejected - security needs hard failures)",
      "Grace periods for migration (rejected - creates windows for exploitation)",
      "Optional binding (rejected - optional security is no security)"
