## 2026-02-19: Meta-Lesson on Skill Improvement

### Process Learning
- **Passing existing tests ≠ proving new behavior**
- Must add regression tests that explicitly trigger the new failure mode
- That's the difference between "seems fine" and "this won't rot"

### Design Learning
- Can hit 9/10 on expressive/emotional pieces
- Hit ~7/10 on functional UI (dashboards/tools)
- **2-point gap = biggest leverage point**

### Decision (committed)
- **Primary focus:** Emotional transfer into functional UI (clarity + feeling, not just layout)
- **Secondary drills:** Light theme confidence + divergence range
- **Already handled:** Problem-first approach (not the bottleneck)

## Design Skill Radar (8 axes, rate 1-10)

Every shipped design, score:

1. **Hierarchy** - what's first/second/third
2. **Spacing + alignment**
3. **Typography** - scale + rhythm
4. **Color** - emotion + readability
5. **Composition** - balance, tension, flow
6. **Interaction clarity** - what can I do here?
7. **Brand fit** - does it feel like *you*
8. **Delight / emotion** - does it make me feel anything?

**Gap detection:**
- Find lowest average score
- Find largest gap between two types of work
- That picks the focus area objectively (no vibes)

## Active Drill: Make a Dashboard Feel Like a Gift

Take one boring dashboard and redo with:
- [ ] Clear emotion target (calm, confident, excited, cared-for)
- [ ] One "hero moment" (one metric that feels celebrated)
- [ ] Softer but intentional contrast (not flat, not shouty)
- [ ] Micro-copy that sounds human (not SaaS robot)
- [ ] One tiny delight detail (hover, easter-egg, killer empty state)

**Functional UI needs MOOD. Not decoration — mood.**

### Fact: Design Skill Radar
- **Claim:** Design Skill Radar: 8-axis scoring system for objective design assessment - Hierarchy, Spacing+alignment, Typography, Color, Composition, Interaction clarity, Brand fit, Delight/emotion. Find lowest average + largest gap between work types to pick focus area objectively.
- **Confidence:** 0.9
- **Tags:** design, methodology, scoring, radar, permanent, framework

### Decision: Emotional Transfer Focus
- **Decision:** Design improvement focus: Prioritize bringing emotional design sensibility into functional UI. Highest-ROI based on 2-point gap (9/10 emotional vs 7/10 functional).
- **Rationale:** Four gaps identified. Emotional transfer shows largest measurable gap and compounds across all functional work.
- **Tags:** design, focus, improvement, emotional-design, strategy
