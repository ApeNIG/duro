## The Builder's Compass Framework

Strategic philosophy for the AI age:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

## Why This Works

### 1. You escaped the feature trap

"Memory for agents" is a commodity sentence. Mem0/Zep can stand next to you and look identical.

"Verify what's true, compose what's useful, remember what's learned" is a **value system**. People don't copy value systems easily because it requires taste, consistency, and leadership—not just code.

### 2. You picked the real bottleneck

In the AI age, generation gets cheap fast. The scarce stuff is:

| Scarce Resource | What It Means |
|-----------------|---------------|
| **Truth** | What's correct / what works |
| **Taste** | What's good / worth doing |
| **Continuity** | What persists and compounds |

The four pillars map cleanly onto that.

### 3. You found a real moat

Features are replicable.
Habits + culture + feedback loops + identity are **not**.

If Duro becomes "how serious builders work," you've basically made a **guild tool**.

---

## The Risks (Because the Universe Hates Clean Narratives)

### Risk 1: Philosophy can turn into fog

If the homepage gets too "movement-y" and not "what does this do on Tuesday," you'll lose practical people.

**Fix:** Philosophy on top, concrete underneath.
Every big claim should collapse into a screenshot, a workflow, or a measurable outcome.

### Risk 2: "Builders who matter" can sound self-important

It's catchy, but it can also read like a crypto bro manifesto if you're not careful.

**Fix:** Keep it humble + precise:
- "Builders who care about correctness."
- "Builders who don't want to ship nonsense."
- "Teams that want learning to compound."

Same energy, less ego.

### Risk 3: Pricing based on vibes won't survive procurement

"Verification is priceless" is true, but finance teams still want numbers.

**Fix:** Tie pricing to saved time, avoided incidents, faster onboarding, fewer regressions, etc.

## Operationalizing the Compass (The Product Spec)

Turn each pillar from positioning into a measurable system:

### MEMORY

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Metric** | % of decisions/facts with sources + confidence |
| **Loop** | decay → review → reinforce |
| **Default Workflow** | Store fact → assign confidence → link source → decay over time → review when stale |
| **Visible Artifact** | Fact cards, decision records, provenance inspector |

### VERIFICATION

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Metric** | Verified vs unverified outputs; regression rate |
| **Loop** | evaluate → label → improve rule/skill |
| **Default Workflow** | Episode completes → evaluate outcome → update skill confidence → flag regressions |
| **Visible Artifact** | Eval reports, audit trail, decision validation history |

### ORCHESTRATION

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Metric** | Task completion rate; tool failures; time-to-recovery |
| **Loop** | route → execute → observe → adapt |
| **Default Workflow** | Check permission → execute tool → log result → adjust reputation |
| **Visible Artifact** | Run logs, tool permissions dashboard, autonomy status |

### DOMAIN EXPERTISE

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Metric** | Reuse rate of skills/rules; "time to first good outcome" |
| **Loop** | pattern → codify → reuse → refine |
| **Default Workflow** | Spot pattern → create skill → use in episodes → track success rate → refine |
| **Visible Artifact** | Skills library, constitutions, rule sets |

**When you do this, the philosophy stops being marketing and becomes an internal compass for roadmapping.**

---

## The Builder's Compass Score

People love a scoreboard. Make it real and slightly brutal:

| Metric | What It Measures | Target |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| **Verification Coverage** | % of decisions with validation status | >70% |
| **Staleness Index** | % of facts past decay threshold | <20% |
| **Decision Closure Rate** | % of decisions validated/reversed within 14 days | >60% |
| **Skill Reuse Rate** | How often codified skills get used | >3x per skill |
| **Tool Reliability** | % of tool calls that succeed | >95% |

This becomes your **dashboard** and your **sales wedge**.

---

## The Killer Loop (Ship This First)

Don't boil the philosophy ocean. The highest leverage loop is:

```
Decision → Outcome → Evaluation → Skill/Rule Update
```

**Why this one?** Because that's compounding intelligence in the raw.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                             │
│   1. Make a decision                                        │
│              ↓                                              │
│   2. Track the outcome (success/partial/failed)             │
│              ↓                                              │
│   3. Evaluate: what worked? what didn't?                    │
│              ↓                                              │
│   4. Update skill confidence / create new rule              │
│              ↓                                              │
│   5. Next time: agent checks past decisions first           │
│              ↓                                              │
│   [COMPOUND INTELLIGENCE]                                   │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## The One-Sentence + One-Screenshot Rule

For every pillar claim, you need one visual proof. Even if it's ugly early.

| Pillar | One Sentence | Screenshot Needed |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Memory** | "Every fact has a source and confidence" | Fact card with provenance |
| **Verification** | "Every decision gets validated" | Decision with outcome status |
| **Orchestration** | "Every action is permissioned" | Autonomy dashboard |
| **Expertise** | "Patterns become reusable skills" | Skills library with usage stats |

---

## Marketing: Teach the Compass, Sell Duro as the Practice

Content ladder:

| Stage | Content | Goal |
|-------|---------|------|
| 1 | Post: "Why verification beats generation" | Attract philosophy-aligned builders |
| 2 | Post: "How to build a decision feedback loop" | Teach the method |
| 3 | Demo: "Here's Duro doing it" | Show the tool |
| 4 | CTA: "Run the Compass on your own work" | Convert to users |

---

## Tightened Positioning (Less Mystical, More Lethal)

**Option A - Outcome-focused:**
> "Duro is how AI teams stop repeating mistakes and start compounding intelligence."

**Option B - Anti-nonsense:**
> "Duro is for builders who don't want to ship nonsense."

**Option C - Audit-forward:**
> "Duro gives your AI agents memory you can audit, decisions you can trace, and skills that compound."

**Option D - The scoreboard angle:**
> "Duro tracks your AI's verification coverage, decision closure rate, and skill reuse. It's the dashboard for compounding intelligence."

---

## The Core Insight (Unchanged)

**Duro IS the Builder's Compass made tangible.**

| Compass Pillar | Duro Feature | How It Works |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Memory** | Facts, Episodes, Decisions | Structured knowledge that compounds over time |
| **Verification** | Decision Validation, Evaluations | Track outcomes, validate what worked |
| **Orchestration** | MCP Server, Autonomy Engine | Coordinate AI agents with permission controls |
| **Domain Expertise** | Skills, Rules, Constitutions | Codify deep knowledge into reusable components |

---

## What To Do Next (In Order)

### 1. Lock the "One Sentence + One Screenshot" rule
For every pillar claim, create one visual proof. Even ugly early versions work.

### 2. Create the Builder's Compass Score
Build the dashboard. Make it real and slightly brutal. This becomes the product and the sales wedge.

### 3. Ship the killer loop first
Decision → Outcome → Evaluation → Skill Update. That's compounding intelligence. Everything else is secondary.

### 4. Content: teach the Compass, sell Duro as practice
- Post: "Why verification beats generation"
- Post: "How to build a decision feedback loop"
- Demo: "Here's Duro doing it"
- CTA: "Run the Compass on your own work"

## Lessons Learned (from Synthesis Feedback)

1. **Philosophy needs screenshots** - Every big claim must collapse into a visual or measurable outcome.

2. **Humble > self-important** - "Builders who matter" → "Builders who care about correctness."

3. **Scoreboard sells** - People love brutal metrics. Build the Compass Score dashboard.

4. **Ship the killer loop first** - Decision → Outcome → Evaluation → Skill Update. That's the compound intelligence loop.

5. **Teach the Compass, sell the practice** - Content strategy: philosophy posts → method posts → demo → CTA.
