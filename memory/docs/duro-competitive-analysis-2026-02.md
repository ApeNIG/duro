## Direct Competitors by Category

### 1. MEMORY SYSTEMS

| Product | Type | Strengths | vs Duro |
|---------|------|-----------|---------|
| **Mem0** | Memory Layer | 26% better accuracy, AWS partnership, $24M funding | Memory-only, no orchestration, no decision tracking |
| **Zep** | Knowledge Graph | Temporal awareness, SOC2/HIPAA, best benchmarks | Cloud-first, no local option, no learning loops |
| **Letta** | MemGPT | 3-tier memory (Core/Recall/Archival), UC Berkeley research | No decision validation, no reputation system |
| **Cognee** | Knowledge Engine | Graph+Vector, 70+ companies, $7.5M funding | No episode tracking, no autonomy controls |
| **SuperMemory** | Personal Memory | Human-like decay, MCP support | Consumer-focused, limited enterprise |

**Verdict:** Mem0 is closest but is a **component**, not a system. Duro is a **complete architecture**.

### 2. ORCHESTRATION FRAMEWORKS

| Product | Type | Strengths | vs Duro |
|---------|------|-----------|---------|
| **CrewAI** | Multi-Agent | Role-based teams, 450M workflows, fastest execution | Cloud-first, no structured memory, no learning |
| **LangGraph** | Graph Workflows | Largest ecosystem, 47M downloads, complex DAGs | State issues at scale, no permission system |
| **AutoGPT** | Autonomous | Visual builder, task decomposition | Cloud-first, no provenance tracking |
| **OpenAI SDK** | Agent Framework | Guardrails, voice agents, official support | Session-based memory only |
| **Claude SDK** | Agent Framework | Powers Claude Code, thinking config | No persistent memory layer |

**Verdict:** Strong orchestration tools exist, but **none combine orchestration + structured learning + local-first**.

### 3. LOCAL-FIRST TOOLS

| Product | Type | Strengths | vs Duro |
|---------|------|-----------|---------|
| **Khoj** | Second Brain | Self-hostable, multi-platform, free | Knowledge retrieval only, no experience learning |
| **Screenpipe** | Screen Memory | MCP support, Rewind alternative, open source | Capture-focused, no orchestration |
| **LocalAI** | API Server | OpenAI replacement, LocalRecall memory | Generic memory, not structured |
| **Ollama** | Model Runner | 100+ models, foundation for ecosystem | Infrastructure only, no memory |
| **Jan.ai** | Chat Interface | Privacy-focused, MCP support | No long-term memory system |

**Verdict:** Local-first tools are either **model runners** or **chat interfaces**. None have Duro's intelligence layer.

### 4. CODING ASSISTANTS

| Product | Memory Type | Persistence | vs Duro |
|---------|------------|-------------|---------|
| **GitHub Copilot** | Repository-level | Yes (Early Access) | Code-only, no decision tracking |
| **Cursor** | Memories + Rules | Yes | IDE-specific, no cross-project learning |
| **Claude Code** | CLAUDE.md files | Yes | No episode evaluation, no reputation |
| **Windsurf** | Auto-generated | Yes | Code-focused only |
| **Aider** | Git-based | Via extension | CLI-only, no orchestration |

**Verdict:** Coding assistants now have memory, but it's **project-scoped**, not **experience-scoped**.

## Threat Assessment

### HIGH THREAT (Watch Closely)

| Competitor | Why | Risk Level |
|------------|-----|------------|
| **Mem0** | $24M funding, AWS partnership, could add orchestration | HIGH |
| **Zep** | Temporal graphs, enterprise focus, could go local | HIGH |
| **Claude Memory** | Native to Claude, could expand features | MEDIUM-HIGH |

### MEDIUM THREAT

| Competitor | Why | Risk Level |
|------------|-----|------------|
| **Khoj** | Similar "second brain" vision, open source | MEDIUM |
| **Letta** | Strong research foundation, could add learning | MEDIUM |
| **LangGraph** | Dominant ecosystem, could add memory | MEDIUM |

### LOW THREAT (Different Focus)

| Competitor | Why | Risk Level |
|------------|-----|------------|
| **CrewAI** | Team orchestration, not personal agent | LOW |
| **Cursor/Copilot** | Code-only, not general purpose | LOW |
| **Ollama/LocalAI** | Infrastructure layer, not intelligence | LOW |

---

## Duro's Moat

### What Would Take Competitors Years to Build:

1. **Structured Learning Architecture**
   - Episodes → Evaluations → Skill Stats → Decisions → Validation
   - This feedback loop compounds intelligence over time

2. **Debug Discipline Infrastructure**
   - 48-hour change ledger
   - Gate-enforced RCA with repro steps
   - First bad boundary identification

3. **Autonomy/Reputation System**
   - Permission levels based on track record
   - Domain-specific trust scores
   - Graceful degradation on failures

4. **Local-First Data Ownership**
   - All artifacts as JSON files
   - SQLite + embeddings
   - No cloud dependency

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### Defend Against Mem0/Zep:
- Emphasize **learning loops** (they have memory, not learning)
- Highlight **local-first** (they're cloud-dependent)
- Show **decision validation** (unique capability)

### Differentiate from Khoj:
- Khoj = knowledge retrieval
- Duro = experiential learning + orchestration
- Position as "Khoj for experiences, not just documents"

### Watch Claude Memory Evolution:
- If Anthropic adds episodes/decisions, pivot messaging
- Current advantage: structured types + local ownership

---

## Market Opportunity

### Duro's Sweet Spot:

> **Power users who want a personal AI that learns from experience, runs locally, and compounds intelligence over time.**

This audience is underserved:
- Enterprise tools (Mem0, Zep) are cloud-first
- Consumer tools (ChatGPT Memory) lack structure
- Developer tools (Cursor, Copilot) are code-only
- PKM tools (Obsidian, Notion) lack agent capabilities
