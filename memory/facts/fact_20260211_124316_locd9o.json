    "claim": "HSL Color Model & Psychology: Hue (0-360° wheel position), Saturation (0-100% intensity), Lightness (0-100% brightness). Color temperature: Warm (red/orange/yellow) = energy, passion, activity. Cool (blue/green/purple) = calm, balance, nature. Psychology: 62-90% of first impressions based on color alone. Cultural variance: Red = danger (West) vs fortune (East). Blue = trust globally. White = purity (West) vs death (East). Highly saturated colors work in small doses only - use muted for large areas, full saturation for accents.",
