Golden Ratio = 1:1.618 proportion found in nature. Rule of thirds is simpler/more flexible for responsive. Both create asymmetry which is more dynamic than symmetry. Place CTAs and key elements on sweet spots. Combine both: place focal points where golden ratio intersects rule-of-thirds gridlines.",
