    "claim": "Bento Grid Design 2026: Modular layout where size = hierarchy (larger cards = more important). Users fixate 2.6x longer on larger elements. Best practices: 12-24px gaps between cards, 12-24px corner radius, max 12-15 visible cards. Use for: dashboards, portfolios, feature showcases, product comparisons. NOT for: sequential flows, forms, long-form reading. Responsive: 4-6 col desktop, 3 col tablet, 1-2 col mobile. Common mistakes: overcrowding, uniform sizing (defeats purpose), abandoning hierarchy.",
