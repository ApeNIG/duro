    "claim": "GEOMETRIC COMPOSITION - CIRCLE OVERLAP RULES:\n\n**Overlap Percentages:**\n- 25-35% overlap: Elements feel RELATED but distinct (partnership)\n- 35-50% overlap: Elements feel UNIFIED as one cluster (Mastercard uses ~30%)\n- 50%+ overlap: Elements merge, lose individual identity\n\n**Size Relationships (Golden Ratio):**\n- Primary circle: 1.0x\n- Secondary: 0.618x (62%) or 1.618x (162%)\n- Tertiary: 0.382x (38%) of primary\n- Example: 400px → 248px → 152px\n\n**Positioning for Unity:**\n- Circles should share a common CENTER OF GRAVITY\n- Arrange on implied diagonal (upper-left to lower-right = forward motion)\n- The INTERSECTION is where meaning lives - it should be visible, not hidden\n\n**Mastercard Lesson:**\n- Circles were a VENN DIAGRAM with purpose (banks + consumers = system)\n- Subtraction > Addition (1990: added 23 teeth = disaster; 2016: removed everything = icon)\n- Patience: took 50+ years to \"earn\" wordless status",
