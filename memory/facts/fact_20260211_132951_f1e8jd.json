    "claim": "11 PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN (Envato Tuts+ Course):\n\n1. **BALANCE** - Visual weight distribution makes design stable. Weight determined by size, shape, color, texture. Lack of balance = layout feels tilted.\n\n2. **UNITY** - Harmony and natural relationship between elements. Achieved through consistent color, style, element association. Lack of unity = chaotic feel.\n\n3. **CONTRAST** - Differences between elements create visual hierarchy. Use color, shape, font, texture. Creates focal points and guides reading order.\n\n4. **EMPHASIS** - Draw attention to specific elements through color, lines, positive/negative space relationships. Contrast strengthens emphasis.\n\n5. **REPETITION** - Repeatedly use same elements for consistency. Repeat fonts, graphic elements, or grids.\n\n6. **PATTERN** - Repeated arrangement of multiple elements enhances viewer experience. Can extend brand graphics or create visual atmosphere. Avoid clutter.",
