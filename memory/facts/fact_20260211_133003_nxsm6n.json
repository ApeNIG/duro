    "claim": "11 PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN (Part 2):\n\n7. **RHYTHM** - Visual beat through repeated elements with slight variation. Creates organized sense of movement, often not directly noticeable.\n\n8. **MOVEMENT** - Path viewer's eye takes through the layout. Arrange elements to guide viewers to key information. Use lines, shapes, organic forms.\n\n9. **PROPORTION** - Relationship between elements enhances unity, balance, harmony. Primary vs secondary info established through size and position.\n\n10. **HARMONY** - Relatedness between elements makes whole cohesive but NOT identical. Achieved through similar colors, fonts, styles.\n\n11. **VARIETY** - Creates contrast and tension, adds visual interest. Mix different shapes, fonts, images, illustration elements.\n\nKEY INSIGHT: \"Principles are the foundation for creating composition. They help establish structure and presentation. Use them as tools to review and edit designs - ensure every element has FUNCTION and PURPOSE.\"",
