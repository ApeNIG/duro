Kandinsky's color-emotion mapping (Yellow=aggressive, Blue=spiritual, Red=powerful, Green=peaceful) drives UI mood. Mondrian's grid constraints inform layout systems. The key insight: abstract art removed representation to reveal pure visual truth - digital design can use these same truths to create interfaces that communicate before users even read.",
