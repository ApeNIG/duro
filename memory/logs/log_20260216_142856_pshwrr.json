Created archive folder (archive/) for raw logs preservation\n3. Created summaries folder (summaries/) for compressed daily summaries\n4. Updated load_recent_memory() with use_summaries=True hybrid approach\n5. Auto-compression in duro_load_context - compresses old logs automatically\n6. New tools: duro_compress_logs, duro_query_archive, duro_list_archives\n7. Tested: Feb 9-11 compressed from 73KB raw to 14KB summaries (80% reduction)\n8. Raw logs preserved in archive/ for full detail retrieval when needed",
