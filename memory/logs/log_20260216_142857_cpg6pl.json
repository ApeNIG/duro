    "message": "Aurora V3.6 - Native Gradient Discovery: Discovered Pencil supports native gradient fills after researching CSS gradients online. Created V3.6 using gradientType:\"radial\" with color stops - achieved TRUE smooth aurora effect with just 2 ellipse nodes instead of 16+ stacked shapes. Key insight: center:{x:0.5, y:1} puts gradient origin at bottom edge, center:{x:0.5, y:0} at top edge. Colors array with position values creates smooth interpolation. This is THE solution for aurora/gradient effects in Pencil.",
