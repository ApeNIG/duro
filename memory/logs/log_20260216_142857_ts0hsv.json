Discovered that stacked ellipse approach in Pencil cannot create true gradients - visible banding, discrete opacity steps, ellipse edges all show. True gradients need native gradient fills or CSS radial-gradient() with mathematical interpolation. Current design looks like layered shapes, not organic light shading.",
