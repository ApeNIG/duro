Detects 3 cluster types: rule_burst, command_repeat, reason_similarity. Dashboard shows clusters with time window, sample commands, common terms, and suggestions. CI emits ::warning:: for clusters >= 5 waivers. Added test_clustering.py (6 tests). Commit da628a9 pushed. Dashboard now goes from scoreboard to diagnostic instrument.",
