A passing build does NOT mean the design is correct or looks good. The process should be: 1) Create visual mockups in pencil.dev first, 2) Implement code, 3) Take screenshots to verify, 4) Compare against mockups, 5) Iterate. Without visual verification, I have no idea if I actually reached the destination.",
