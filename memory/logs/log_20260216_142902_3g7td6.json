    "message": "Abstract/Dynamic Design Principles (2026): 1) Motion as brand identity - consistent timing curves and easing that become recognizable markers. 2) Quiet but smart motion - less showy animations, more rhythmic/purposeful micro-movements. 3) Progressive disclosure - content reveals through scroll/interaction, not all at once. 4) Layered gradients with blend modes (screen, overlay, multiply) for dimensional effects. 5) Typography as motion - variable fonts, staggered character animations, letter-spacing changes on scroll. 6) Depth without imagery - shadows, layers, spacing, and stacking contexts create dimensionality. 7) Scroll-based storytelling (scrollytelling) - mixed directional narratives, chapter-like progression.",
