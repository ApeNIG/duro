Apply consistent brand-specific timing curves across all animations. Micro-interactions should respond proportionally (not binary on/off). Stagger animations create rhythm - delay children slightly from each other. Spring physics feels more natural than linear easing. Gesture-based interactions (drag, swipe) need momentum/inertia.",
