Key discoveries: 1) Hierarchy = energy distribution, not just info order - the biggest element carries the most energy, 2) \"Load-bearing element\" is a better mental model than \"use 32px\" - asks \"what happens if this fails?\", 3) Design for circulation (Entry \u2192 Main \u2192 Details \u2192 Exit) not just layout, 4) Weird only works when grounded in native context, 5) Ghost elements (low opacity) add depth without competing. V2 (architecture lens) won on execution. The cross-domain injection round produced the most coherent result.",
