Two parallel agents (Team A: Music\u2192Africa via Jazz/Blues, Team B: Africa\u2192Music via Afrobeat) found paths in ~5 seconds with sources, while the API's BFS explored 243 topics over 15.5 seconds and failed. Key insight: starting from both ends and using semantically relevant bridges (like Fela Kuti, Afrobeat) is far more effective than random graph traversal.",
