V2 succeeded (85% match) by using giant off-canvas blobs (120%+ size, -55% offset), layered depth hierarchy (dark\u2192accent\u2192accent\u2192vignette), 7% white card fill with 24px blur, diagonal sheen, and top haze. Key insight: you should NOT be able to identify the background shapes as circles.",
