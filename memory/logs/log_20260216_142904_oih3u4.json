    "message": "Stacked ellipses cannot replicate true gradients. Real gradients use mathematical interpolation between color stops (seamless, continuous transition). Simulating with layered shapes creates visible banding, discrete opacity jumps, and ellipse edges. To achieve gradient-like effects in tools without native gradient support: need 50-100+ layers with tiny opacity increments, or export to code where CSS radial-gradient() provides true smooth fades.",
