    "message": "Pencil MCP design-to-code translation CAN be pixel-perfect accurate, but requires systematic extraction not approximation. Key process: 1) Use `batch_get` to extract exact values (fontSize, fontWeight, padding, gap, colors as hex), 2) Use `snapshot_layout` to verify computed positions of children (reveals actual padding vs no padding), 3) The cornerRadius format `[16,0,0,0]` needs clarification - may not mean only top-left rounded, 4) Never add padding/spacing that isn't in the Pencil data, 5) The `get_guidelines(topic=\"code\")` provides detailed workflow for accurate translation including component validation steps.",
