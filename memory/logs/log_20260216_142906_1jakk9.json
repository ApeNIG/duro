Dark enterprise cards score well (29/30) with gold accents on dark backgrounds. Glassmorphism needs subtle execution to avoid looking dated. Neubrutalism works best for brand-heavy contexts where bold borders reinforce identity. Data cards benefit from color-coded change indicators (green positive, red negative).",
