Key insight from Letta benchmarks: simple filesystem operations (74% accuracy) beat specialized memory tools (68.5%). Simpler tools agents have seen in training work better than exotic memory systems. For Duro, task-aware loading with existing tools likely beats building complex virtual memory manager.",
