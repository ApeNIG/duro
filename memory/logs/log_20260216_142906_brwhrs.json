    "message": "Page Layout Patterns from 15-layout drill: (1) Whitespace layouts score highest - empty space commands attention. (2) Editorial layouts (pull quotes, multi-column) require careful typography. (3) Zigzag flows create rhythm but can feel predictable. (4) Bento grids need varied tile sizes with one clear feature tile. (5) Split screens work best with high contrast (dark/light). (6) Full-bleed media needs gradient overlays for text legibility. (7) Brutalist intentionally breaks rules - scores lowest but has strong identity. (8) Overlapping elements create depth but risk visual noise.",
