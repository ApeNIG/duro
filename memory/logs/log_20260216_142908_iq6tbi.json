Key prompt that unlocks bold design: \"How would you know where the line is if you don't try and cross it?\" This signals: 1) Permission to break conventions, 2) Explore boundaries, 3) Show personality, 4) Take creative risks. Response should abandon safe patterns (sidebars, equal grids, muted colors) and embrace expressive choices (oversized type, asymmetry, bold gradients, mixed materials).",
