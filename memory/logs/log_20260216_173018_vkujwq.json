    "message": "Emotional Design (Don Norman's 3 Levels): 1) Visceral - immediate aesthetic reaction (colors, shapes, first impression), 2) Behavioral - usability and function pleasure (smooth interactions, predictable responses), 3) Reflective - meaning and self-image (what using this says about me). Premium feel markers: generous whitespace, refined typography hierarchy, subtle shadows with blur, deliberate color restraint, micro-animations with easing. Cheap feel markers: cramped layouts, inconsistent spacing, too many colors, harsh shadows, abrupt transitions. Trust signals: consistent visual language, professional photography, clear hierarchy, appropriate density.",
