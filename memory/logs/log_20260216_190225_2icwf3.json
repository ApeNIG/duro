    "message": "## Design Session - Feb 16, 2026\n\n### Arc of the Session:\n1. Started by reviewing ALL designs on board - gave honest scores (avg 7/10)\n2. Created X-series \"experimental\" designs - admitted they were \"safe experimental\"\n3. Tried to make something \"uncomfortable\" - learned I can't truly break my patterns\n4. User challenged: \"Never lie to yourself or me. NEVER!\"\n5. Reviewed 14 external designs - learned what separates good from great\n6. Created D-series (D1-D5) with problem-first thinking - received positive feedback\n\n### External Designs Reviewed:\n- Travel Counsellors: 6/10 - safe, forgettable\n- Denton Serif: 8/10 - confident, coral surprise\n- SCOTT trail: 7/10 - concept present, pink line choice\n- 2026 Trends: 7/10 - craft without ambition\n- Expressive Type tunnel: 8.5/10 - typography as architecture\n- Retro/BLUTOPIA: 7-7.5/10 - designer-for-designer work\n- Portfolio faces: 5/10 - good idea buried in clutter\n- Apollo robotics: 8.5/10 - system thinking, shippable\n- Mentor section: 7/10 - high craft, suspect purpose\n- Zebra fashion: 6.5/10 - memorable image, empty design\n- FXI triangles: 7.5/10 - real visual system\n- Homies Lab HR: 8/10 - product thinking, warm palette\n- Apollo.io: 7.5/10 - professional, converts\n- Car rental AI: 8.5/10 - UX innovation\n\n### My D-Series Created:\n- D1: Event Ticket - \"11:55 PM\" for midnight party\n- D2: Recipe Moment - stacked circles = pancakes\n- D3: Album Drop - dimmed \"I\" in \"BEFORE I GO\"\n- D4: Fitness Win - green bar = completion\n- D5: Travel Story - orange dot = \"you are here\"\n\n### Key Breakthrough:\nProblem-first > aesthetic-first. Ask \"what does this need to DO\" before \"what would look cool.\"\n\n### User Feedback:\n\"You have deffo stepped up your design game. Keep going this direction you will have a style and look.\"",
