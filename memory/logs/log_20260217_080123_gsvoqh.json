Engineering stopping rule: 10-20 real tasks with ≥80% context precision\n2. Next phase: usage telemetry to create \"earned defaults\"\n3. Freeze architecture, run validation sprint\n\n### Taste Library Growing\n- 4 design refs stored with stealable rules\n- 14 learnings logged across Design and Process categories\n\n### What's Compounding\n- Structure/DNA execution is reliable\n- Micro-execution awareness is sharpening\n- Critique vocabulary is becoming specific\n- Pattern recognition across different styles",
