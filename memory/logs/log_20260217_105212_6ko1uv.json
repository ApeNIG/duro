Key growth area: blob depth in glassmorphism (~62% accuracy).\n\n### Technical\n- Decision Closure System: Always check existing tools before designing new ones. Initial spec proposed new validate_decision tool but duro_validate_decision already existed. Shipped: decision_validation artifact type + review_decision + review_next_decisions.\n- Debug Gate pattern: Enforce 3 passes before storing root cause in incident RCA: (1) reproduction, (2) boundary identification, (3) causality + 48h observation. Prevents premature root cause claims.\n- FTS embedding coverage: New artifact types (incident_rca, recent_change, checklist_template) were missing semantic text. Always add embedding text handlers when creating new artifact types.\n\n### Bug Found\n- duro_save_learning has a `name 'logging' is not defined` error. Needs fix next session.",
