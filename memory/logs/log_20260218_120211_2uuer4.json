    "message": "Phase 5 self-review of BrandForge UI uncovered several critical issues: (1) Missing template pack selector in batch creation - would have caused all batch creation to fail with placeholder packId, (2) No error/success feedback in brand-kit-editor and batch-actions - poor UX, (3) False promise of \"auto-refresh\" for processing batches with no actual polling implementation, (4) Unused props passed between components. Self-review caught issues that would have been production bugs. Always review code as if someone else wrote it - removes bias and catches blind spots.",
