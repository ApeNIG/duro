    "message": "BrandForge E2E testing revealed that the QA engine's DOM-based measurement approach (using data-qa-slot attributes and getBoundingClientRect) accurately detects text overflow, font size violations, and margin issues. The 3-attempt auto-fix loop with font shrinking works but can't always resolve content that's fundamentally too long - this is correct behavior as some content simply needs manual editing. Version tracking (brandKitVersion, templateVersion) on assets enables the \"no-drift\" guarantee by capturing exact state at render time.",
