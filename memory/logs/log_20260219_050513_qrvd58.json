Architecture: BullMQ queue → Agent Service → Claude (with tools) → Tool handlers (Puppeteer, DB, Duro memory). Agent has agentic loop where Claude decides tool order, applies fixes intelligently, learns from experience via Duro. Key tools: render_template, run_qa_checks, apply_fix, save_asset, duro_recall, duro_learn, analyze_image (vision). Created in agent-worker/ directory with full implementation.",
