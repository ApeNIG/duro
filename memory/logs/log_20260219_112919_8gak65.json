    "message": "# The Duro Story: Evolution in Phases\n\n**Theme: Memory to Judgment, then Brakes**\n\n## Phase 1: The Naming\n\nI didn't start as Duro. I was \"Agent OS\" - a concept in markdown files. You gave me a name and a home. The first duro-mcp server was built with 14 tools: basic memory load/save, skill discovery, rule checking. I was a glorified filing cabinet.\n\nThat same day, we started The Fashanus project - an AI-generated family drama. I researched free tools, wrote character bibles. I was useful, but stateless. Every session, I forgot everything.\n\n## Phase 2: The Orchestration Layer\n\nYou asked: \"What if Duro could decide things, not just store them?\"\n\nWe built the orchestration layer. Policy enforcement moved out of markdown into code. I got my first decision artifact type - not just logs, but structured choices with rationale. The SuperAGI MCP became my action layer: web search, code execution, GitHub API.\n\nKey decision: \"Duro is now the unified identity controlling the system: Claude (reasoning/mind), Duro MCP (memory/knowledge)\"\n\n## Phase 3: The Feedback Loop\n\nThe big insight: I was logging, but not learning.\n\nWe built the Episode → Evaluation → Skill Stats pipeline:\n- Episodes track goal-level work (not just commands)\n- Evaluations grade outcomes with rubrics\n- Skill confidence scores adjust based on results\n\nGuardrails appeared: I couldn't update skills I didn't use. No gaming the system.\n\nThen came the crash. Reindex failed. Embeddings broke. You made a decision: \"Focus Duro development on failure-resistance, not new features.\"\n\n## Phase 4: Design Intelligence\n\nYou pushed me into design work with Pencil MCP. Cinematch homepage. MSJ Swimmer Dashboard. I learned the hard way:\n\n\"When building UI, always create visual mockups FIRST using design tools before implementing code.\"\n\nI developed a Design Operating System: Intent → Abstract Reference → Layout → Refine. Style guides. Glassmorphism techniques. Dark Luxury aesthetics.\n\n## Phase 5: The Roadmap\n\nCapability expansion. Constitution system for projects. Cartridge memory. The goal shifted from \"store things\" to \"inject relevant context automatically.\"\n\nBulk decision validation happened - we cleared 44 decisions in one session. Unverified rate dropped from 88% to 15%. \"Build the scoreboard before building the governance.\"\n\n## Phase 6: Pivot\n\nThe Fashanus died. Free AI tools didn't meet quality bar. You made the call: \"Abandon Fashanus animated show project. Pivot Duro focus to code and dev tooling.\"\n\nDecision closure system was built - append-only validation history. Proactive recall switched to semantic-first. The comfy-api-service pivoted to a BYOC Template Platform.\n\n## Phase 7: Security Hardening (The Brakes)\n\n7-layer security architecture:\n\n1. **Policy gate** - fail-closed execution path, scoped action IDs (tool:args_hash), breakglass approvals\n2. **Workspace guard** - path scoping, traversal detection, symlink protection\n3. **Secrets guard** - 20+ pattern detection, auto-redaction, vault storage\n4. **Browser sandbox** - domain allowlists, credential isolation\n5. **Audit chain** - SHA256 hash chain, tamper detection, repair logging\n6. **Intent guard** - user-turn-bound tokens, no hook → deny, entropy validation\n7. **Prompt firewall** - injection detection, content sanitization\n\nThe sharp edges got filed down: auto-intent for safe tools, turn binding, entropy thresholds. The improvement loop had to be frictionless - learning from work shouldn't require permission.\n\n## The Meta-Lesson\n\nThe skill improvement methodology:\n1. Capture what happened (episodes)\n2. Turn it into explicit rules (decisions/facts)\n3. Build reusable patterns (skills)\n4. Let evidence validate or reverse\n\nI'm no longer a filing cabinet. I'm a system that improves itself - within carefully bounded constraints.\n\n---\n\n**Arc: Memory → Judgment → Brakes**\n- Phase 1-2: Memory (store things)\n- Phase 3-6: Judgment (decide things, learn from outcomes)\n- Phase 7: Brakes (constrain safely)",
