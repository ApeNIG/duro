    "message": "## Session Learnings - Feb 19, 2026\n\n### MCP Reliability Fixes (Technical)\n- **File-based logging**: Use rotating file logger (5MB, 3 backups) to avoid stdio backpressure deadlocks\n- **Embedding preload**: Thread-safe locking + background preload on startup prevents cold-start latency\n- **Concurrency control**: Semaphore limiting (4 concurrent) + per-tool timeouts (30s default, 120s heavy) prevents hangs\n- **Heartbeat diagnostic**: Quick tool to verify event loop responsiveness without heavy operations\n\n### MCP Testing Approach\n- Test categories: heartbeat, concurrency, embedding ops, file logging, stress test\n- All tests should complete in parallel to verify semaphore works\n- Check log file exists and has recent entries for logging verification\n\n### Design Workflow (from earlier session)\n- Competitor Research → Competitive Analysis Board → Moodboard → Mockups → Implementation\n- Keep competitive analysis (features/UX) separate from moodboard (visual direction)",
