Timeout at 120s correctly triggered cancellation signal.\n\n**Test B (Timeout Isolation):** After heavy timeout, fast tools worked instantly:\n- Heartbeat: 0.02ms latency\n- Semantic search: returned 3 results\n- Concurrency: 3/4 available\n\n**Confirmed working:**\n- Fast vs heavy executor split\n- Heavy dogpile prevention (semaphore=1)\n- Timeout → quarantine + cancel signal\n\n**Note:** decay/compress don't have checkpoint loops yet - enhancement for later if needed.",
