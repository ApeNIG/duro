# Summary: 2026-02-16

## Learnings
- For production-quality AI generation on a budget: Flux via FAL.ai ($0.04/image) matches DALL-E quality at same cost but faster. Minimax/Hailuo ($0.27/6s video) has free tier and is 50% cheaper than Runway. Kling AI ($0.30/5s) offers best motion quality. Always build a cost estimator skill when adding paid backends - users need to validate budgets before running jobs.
- When user has hardware limitations (can't run local AI models) and cost constraints (RunPod too expensive), focus on: (1) Free tiers first (Pollinations, Minimax free), (2) Per-use APIs over subscriptions for low volume, (3) Cost comparison tools to find optimal backends per job.
- Design workflow for alabi-portfolio and similar projects: ALWAYS use Pencil.dev to create mockups first, evaluate them visually, iterate on what's working, and only then implement in code. This allows for faster iteration and better design outcomes. Never skip the mockup phase.
- Never assume or make up personal information like names. If a name or personal detail isn't explicitly provided, ask the user. Names are critical - getting them wrong is unacceptable. User's name: Alabi Ibagun.
- Design workflow (corrected): 1) Open Pencil.dev, 2) Create mockup variations, 3) In autonomous mode: rate your own work and self-critique (this builds better judgment), 4) Iterate on the design based on self-evaluation, 5) Only then implement in code. Self-rating develops stronger creative instincts.
- Swiss Clean design system for SaaS dashboards: Zero corner radius, single red accent (#E42313), Space Grotesk for headings + Inter for body, #0D0D0D soft black for text, #E8E8E8 borders, generous spacing. Geometric logo marks, red dot indicators for active nav states.
- Claude Code's -p (print) mode requires --allowedTools flag to auto-approve MCP tools. Without it, MCP tools like Duro require interactive permission approval which doesn't work in non-interactive mode.
- To add local MCP servers to Claude Code, use 'claude mcp add <name> <command> <args>' - this writes to .claude.json project config. Settings in ~/.claude/settings.json may not be loaded the same way.
- For Telegram bots with voice support: Use faster-whisper (tiny model) for efficient transcription on low-RAM servers. Telegram sends voice as .ogg files. Bot workflow: download voice -> transcribe with Whisper -> send to Claude -> return response.
- Hookify plugin with 4 hook entry points (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Stop) spawns Python subprocesses on every tool call, causing potential hangs. The leaner approach is enforcement_patterns.json loaded directly by pretooluse.py - same protection, no subprocess overhead per hook type.

## Tasks Completed
- Add ComfyUI backend to Duro image_generate.py skill: Successfully added ComfyUI as new backend option. Changes: (1) SDK import with graceful fallback, (2) COMFYUI enum value, (3) ComfyUI config entries (base_url, api_key_env, timeout, poll_interval, steps, cfg_scale, sampler), (4) generate_comfyui handler with full error handling, (5) Handler registered in BACKEND_HANDLERS, (6) Default fallback order: Pollinations -> ComfyUI -> DALL-E -> Stock, (7) SKILL_META bumped to v1.1.0 with 600s timeout
- Add production-quality AI generation backends (Flux, Kling, Minimax) and cost estimator: Successfully implemented: (1) Flux via FAL.ai backend for image_generate.py (~$0.04/image, excellent quality), (2) video_generate.py skill with Minimax/Hailuo (~$0.27/6s) and Kling AI (~$0.30/5s) backends, (3) production_cost_estimator.py for calculating costs before jobs run. Updated skills/index.json with all new skills.
- Session: Add production-quality AI backends to Duro skills: Completed full implementation: (1) ComfyUI backend for image_generate.py, (2) Flux via FAL.ai backend, (3) video_generate.py with Minimax/Hailuo + Kling AI, (4) production_cost_estimator.py for budget planning. Two commits pushed: 838a1db (ComfyUI) and 44972b3 (Flux, video gen, cost estimator). User now has professional-grade generation stack at ~$2-3 per typical production.
- Redesigned seto-rota application with Swiss Clean design system: Created Pencil.dev mockups (Login + Dashboard), self-rated and iterated designs to 8.5/10, then implemented: globals.css design tokens, split-screen auth layout, Swiss Clean login form, geometric sidebar with red active indicators, design-tokens.ts utility. Full workflow: mockup → critique → iterate → implement.
- Set up remote Claude access via Telegram with Duro memory: Successfully deployed Claude Telegram bot on DigitalOcean droplet ($6/month). Features: 24/7 availability, Duro memory integration, voice note transcription with Whisper AI, Notion/Vercel MCP access. User can now chat with Claude from phone with full context and memory. Server: 165.22.115.170
- Set up Git-based memory sync between local Windows machine and DigitalOcean server: Successfully configured bidirectional git sync for .agent memory repo. Created sync scripts for both machines. Fixed SQLite database conflicts by excluding .db files from git tracking. Server has hourly cron job, local has manual push/pull scripts.
- Fix Duro logging - artifact store was never being called: Added artifact_store.store_log() calls to all 4 logging handlers (save_memory, save_learning, log_task, log_failure)
- Test logging after fix: Verifying artifact store is now being called
- Test logging functionality: Both save_memory and log_task working correctly
- Session: Quick logging verification: Confirmed both save_memory and log_task functions working correctly after earlier artifact store fix.
- Add max_chars truncation to duro_query_archive: Fixed large MCP response warning. Default 4000 chars, use max_chars=0 for full. Commit 9989779 pushed to duro-mcp.
- Comprehensive Duro production readiness check: All core systems operational. Fixed 2 bugs: (1) rules.py key mismatch - now shows 13 rules instead of 0, (2) duro_query_archive truncation - prevents context overflow. 35/35 enforcement tests pass, 7/7 smoke tests pass. 11 evals need skill_path (workflow evals, not blockers). System is production-ready.
- Add logging safeguards to prevent silent failures: Added return value checking to all 4 logging handlers + warning logs on failure + TEST 8 in smoke suite to catch regressions. Commit bf211ea pushed.
- System check and hookify optimization: Diagnosed hook hangs caused by hookify plugin. Disabled plugin, merged 7 .local.md rules into enforcement_patterns.json v2.0 (11 hard rules). Deleted redundant files. System now lean and fast with same protection level.
