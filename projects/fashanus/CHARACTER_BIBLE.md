## Themes

1. **Love expressed badly** - Everyone loves everyone, but it comes out wrong
2. **Generational gaps** - Nigerian/British, parent/child
3. **Identity** - Mixed race, immigrant, woman finding herself
4. **What we carry** - Tunde's past, Rachel's search, Maya's performance
5. **The weight of silence** - What's not said, what Tayo absorbs
