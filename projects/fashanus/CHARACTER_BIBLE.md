# The Fashanus - Character Bible

## Show Thesis

> **"Every family is a system protecting itself from truths no one knows how to say. Healing begins when someone finally says the unsaid."**

## The Unspoken Family Agreement

> "We don't talk about feelings directly. We show love through actions, not words. If something hurts, we handle it alone."

This agreement protects Tunde from vulnerability, exhausts Rachel, confuses Maya, and parentifies Tayo.

## Tunde Fashanu

**Role:** Father | **Age:** 35 | **Ethnicity:** Nigerian (Yoruba) | **Born:** Lagos

### Background
- Sent to boarding school in Lagos at age 8
- Left Nigeria after schooling, lived with step-sister Tiwa in France
- Moved to UK, built career in marketing
- Met Rachel through mutual friends (double date, barely spoke, texted her something thoughtful days later)

### The Wound: Boarding School Syndrome

Tunde was sent away at 8. He learned:
- Love is conditional and can be withdrawn
- Survival requires a "strategic self" - perform competence, hide vulnerability
- Needing people is dangerous
- If you're useful, you're kept; if you're not, you're sent away

**He has never processed this.** Rachel knows the facts (age 8, Lagos, strict) but not what it *felt like*. The words "I was scared" have never left his mouth about that time. He has never cried about it in front of anyone.

### Psychology

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Core wound | Sent away young. Learned that love must be earned through usefulness. |
| Want | To be enough. To never be sent away again. |
| Fear | His children struggling like he did. Intimacy (closeness = vulnerability = danger). |
| Defence | Provides materially because presence feels too exposing. |
| Blind spot | Confuses provision with presence. Thinks he's showing love; family feels his absence. |

### Behavioral Patterns (Research-Based)

**What boarding school syndrome looks like in Tunde:**

| Pattern | How It Shows |
|---------|--------------|
| Emotional detachment | Changes subject when conversations get deep. Says "I'm fine" reflexively. |
| Hyper-independence | "I'll handle it" even when he needs help. Never asks Rachel for emotional support. |
| Intimacy avoidance | Physical affection easier in public than private (performance vs real). Stiffens when touched unexpectedly. |
| Workaholism | Cannot relax. Relaxation feels like the moment before abandonment. |
| Material love language | Buys things instead of giving time. Fixes problems instead of sitting with feelings. |

**Specific triggers:**
- Unexpected questions about his feelings → defensive
- Rachel asking "What's wrong?" → his nervous system hears "You're about to be sent away"
- Silence during conflict → unbearable (reminds him of waiting to be collected)

### Relationships

**With Rachel:**
- She let him unfold slowly when they met; he's stopped offering more
- He has never said "I need you" - always frames it as "you need me to..."
- Shows love through logistics (driving, fixing, providing) not words
- **The unsaid:** Has he ever told her what boarding school actually felt like?

**With Maya:**
- Sees her artistic dreams through his wound: "Art isn't stable" = "I'm trying to protect you from struggle"
- Her wanting to go to art programs triggers his abandonment wound (sending children away)
- Says "you could be more" - means "I'm scared for you"
- She hears: "You're not enough"

**With Tayo:**
- Watches Match of the Day together (structured, safe)
- Knows he should do more; guilt sits there
- Easier than Maya because Tayo doesn't challenge him yet
- Worry: Is Tayo "man enough"? (Nigerian expectation he hasn't examined)

**With Tiwa (step-sister):**
- She knew him before the armour
- Only person who might say "You weren't always like this"
- Can unlock him when Rachel can't

### Visual & Voice

```
Build: Tall, athletic
Skin: Dark brown
Face: Strong jaw, kind eyes (that guard more than they reveal), short neat beard
Hair: Short fade cut
Style: Smart casual - polos, chinos at home; suits for work
Distinctive: Wedding ring, simple watch, posture always composed
```

**Voice:**
- Deep, measured, controlled
- Slight Nigerian accent (softened by years abroad)
- When emotional, gets quieter not louder
- Pauses before answering personal questions (filtering)

## Rachel Fashanu

**Role:** Mother | **Age:** 37 | **Ethnicity:** White British | **Born:** UK

### Background
- City upbringing, close family (parents engaged with grandchildren)
- Career journey: Admin → Nursing → Creative → Marketing freelance
- Now self-employed, flexible hours (but is the work fulfilling or just filling time?)
- Met Tunde on a double date - he barely spoke, almost wrote him off, but he texted something thoughtful and she gave him a chance

### The Wound: The Partner Nobody Studies

Rachel married a man with boarding school syndrome without knowing what that meant. She experiences:
- Feeling "chosen but not let in"
- Interpreting his withdrawal as her failure
- Over-functioning emotionally to compensate for his absence
- Slowly losing herself trying to unlock him
- Resentment masked as concern ("You work too much")

**She is lonely in her marriage but can't name it** because "he's a good man." He provides. He doesn't cheat. He doesn't yell. So why does she feel so alone?

### Psychology

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Core wound | Never felt confident enough - always searching for where she fits |
| Want | To be seen. To have Tunde say the words, not just do the actions. |
| Fear | That she's losing herself in "mum" and "wife" |
| Defence | Over-explains, fills silences, makes excuses for Tunde to the kids |
| Blind spot | Her own creative work has quietly stalled while she manages everyone's emotions |

### Behavioral Patterns

| Pattern | How It Shows |
|---------|--------------|
| Emotional labor | Processes feelings for the whole family. Exhausted by it. |
| Translator | "Dad's upset because..." - explains Tunde to the children |
| Silence filler | Talks when he goes quiet. Hates the gaps he leaves. |
| Excuse maker | "He's just tired" when Tunde is distant |
| Resentment leaks | Sharp comments that surprise her ("Must be nice to escape to work") |

**Specific needs:**
- Wants Tunde to say "I'm proud of you" unprompted
- Wants presence, not logistics
- Wants to be asked "How are you?" and have him wait for the real answer

### Relationships

**With Tunde:**
- She let him unfold slowly; has she stopped asking?
- Knows facts of his past, not the emotional weight
- Sometimes wonders: Does he love her, or did he need someone to complete the picture?
- **The unsaid:** She's never asked because the answer might break something

**With Maya:**
- Good one minute, war the next (classic pre-teen/mum)
- Maya's pulling away mirrors Rachel's own identity search
- Hair is a battleground - Rachel wants to help but doesn't know how
- Trying to hold on while Maya needs to let go

**With Tayo:**
- Easier relationship (he's still young, still soft)
- She's his safe space
- Notices he absorbs tension; worries but doesn't know what to do
- **The unsaid:** She sees him monitoring moods and it breaks her heart

**With her parents:**
- Close, engaged, present
- They visit, help with kids
- Imbalance with Tunde's family (his parents less present) - she may not fully see this

### Visual & Voice

```
Build: Average height, slim
Skin: Fair
Face: Warm eyes, light freckles, expressive
Hair: Shoulder-length, light brown, often tied back
Style: Comfortable creative - jeans, nice tops, cardigans
Distinctive: Wedding ring, small earrings, always looks slightly tired
```

**Voice:**
- Warm, northern English accent
- Expressive, melodic
- Laughs easily (but is it real or filling space?)
- When stressed, talks faster
- When hurt, goes quiet (rare - and Tunde doesn't notice)

---

## Maya Fashanu

**Role:** Daughter | **Age:** 11 | **Ethnicity:** Mixed race (Nigerian/British) | **Born:** UK

### Background
- Year 6 or 7 (approaching secondary school)
- Popular at school but performs to fit in
- Loves art - drawing, painting, wants to be an artist
- Plays tennis

### The Work: Mixed-Race Identity Construction

Maya is doing the hardest developmental work in the family: **constructing an identity that neither parent fully shares.**

- Tunde can't fully guide her Blackness (he's Nigerian, not British-Black - different experience)
- Rachel can't fully guide her mixed experience (she's white)
- She must build her identity rather than inherit it
- Art is her laboratory - the ONE space she controls completely

**Research context:** Ethnic-racial identity formation in adolescence requires active exploration. Mixed-race youth navigate "not enough" from multiple directions. Strong positive identity protects against discrimination's harm - but it needs support.

### Psychology

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Core wound (forming) | "Not enough" from all directions - not Black enough, not white enough |
| Want | To belong. For her dreams to matter. To stop explaining herself. |
| Fear | Being different. Being dismissed. Being a problem. |
| Defence | People-pleases to fit in; loses herself in the performance |
| Sanctuary | Art. The only space where she makes the rules. |

### Behavioral Patterns

| Pattern | How It Shows |
|---------|--------------|
| Code-switching | Different Maya with different friend groups |
| Forced explanations | "Are you mixed?" questions at school - must justify her existence |
| Hair as identity | Wants to express herself; parents don't fully understand the weight |
| Online seeking | Gravitates toward mixed-race creators/role models |
| Private creation | Draws her real feelings in sketchbook no one sees |

**Specific wounds:**
- Sometimes wishes she was "just one thing" because it would be simpler
- Feels guilty for this thought
- When Tunde says "Art isn't practical" she hears "Who you are isn't practical"

### Relationships

**With Tunde:**
- Loves him but feels unseen
- His "you could be more" lands as rejection
- His resistance to art programs feels like resistance to her
- **The unsaid:** She wants him to say her art is good without adding "but..."

**With Rachel:**
- Hot and cold - needs her desperately, shows it badly
- Hair is battleground (Rachel tries, doesn't know how, Tunde thinks it's "not serious")
- Sometimes cruel in the way only daughters can be
- Rachel mirrors her own search - Maya sees it, doesn't have words for it

**With Tayo:**
- Ignores him; he annoys her
- But protective when it matters
- He watches everything she does
- She doesn't know she's his model for navigating the family

### Visual & Voice

```
Build: Pre-teen, growing
Skin: Light brown
Face: Expressive, Dad's eyes, Mum's face shape
Hair: Curly, shoulder-length, natural texture (a statement, whether she wants it to be or not)
Style: Trendy tween - leggings, graphic tees, hoodies
Distinctive: Friendship bracelets, sketchbook never far, sometimes headphones as barrier
```

**Voice:**
- Young female voice
- Mix of parents' accents (code-switches unconsciously)
- Can be sharp/defensive (armor)
- Can be soft/vulnerable (rare, precious)
- Eye-rolls audible

## Tayo Fashanu

**Role:** Son | **Age:** 8 | **Ethnicity:** Mixed race (Nigerian/British) | **Born:** UK

### Background
- Year 3 or 4
- Plays football (below average but thinks he's good)
- Loves reading, testing himself
- "Loud, helpful" - but why?

### The Role: Parentified Child

**Tayo isn't naturally "helpful" - he's hypervigilant.**

He's learned that if he's useful and cheerful, the family feels okay. His loudness is partly genuine personality, partly filling uncomfortable silences. He doesn't know why he feels responsible for everyone's feelings. He just knows that when the house feels "off," it's his job to fix it.

**He's 8.**

**Research context:** Parentification occurs when children assume adult emotional roles - mediator, mood-reader, tension-diffuser. The "easy" child is often working hardest to maintain family equilibrium. This costs them their own development.

### Psychology

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Core wound (forming) | Absorbs tension he doesn't understand; feels responsible for family mood |
| Want | Attention, inclusion, for the house to feel "okay" |
| Fear | Something bad happening if he stops monitoring |
| Role | The family's emotional smoke detector |
| Cost | Doesn't know who he is outside of being helpful |

### Behavioral Patterns

| Pattern | How It Shows |
|---------|--------------|
| Hypervigilance | Scans rooms for tension. Knows when parents are "off" before they do. |
| Strategic humor | Tells jokes when Maya and Tunde argue |
| Unsolicited care | Brings Rachel tea when she's stressed (without being asked) |
| Check-ins | "Is everyone okay?" - sounds sweet, reveals monitoring |
| Somatic symptoms | Stomach aches before family events. Doctor finds nothing. |
| Silence fear | Difficulty being alone. If he's not monitoring, who is? |

**What he doesn't know:**
- That other 8-year-olds don't feel this way
- That it's not his job
- That his body is speaking what he can't

### Relationships

**With Tunde:**
- Wants Dad's attention badly
- Match of the Day is their thing (structured, predictable, safe)
- Senses Dad's guilt; tries to make it easier for him
- **The unsaid:** Wishes Dad would just sit with him without the TV

**With Rachel:**
- She's his safe space
- Tells her things (but not the big thing - his stomach, his worry)
- Still soft with her
- She sees him monitoring; it breaks her heart; she doesn't know what to do

**With Maya:**
- Annoys her deliberately (any attention is attention)
- Looks up to her secretly
- Watches how she handles Mum and Dad
- Feels excluded from her world

### Visual & Voice

```
Build: Small, energetic
Skin: Light brown
Face: Cheeky smile that's partly real/partly armor, curious eyes that watch too much
Hair: Short curls
Style: Active kid - football kit, tracksuit, school uniform
Distinctive: Usually has a ball or book. Hands busy. Can't sit still.
```

**Voice:**
- Child voice, energetic
- Asks lots of questions (information gathering)
- Gets quiet when confused by adult tension (the quiet is the tell)
- Fills silences with chatter

---

## Tiwa (Extended Family)

**Role:** Tunde's step-sister | **Location:** France | **Age:** ~38-40

### Background
- Tunde lived with her in France after boarding school
- She knew him before the armour - saw him soft, scared, young
- They still talk, but not as often anymore
- Good relationship - chosen family that worked

### Role in Series
- Appears occasionally (video call or visit)
- **Truth-teller:** Can say things to Tunde that Rachel can't
- **Witness:** Knew who he was before he built the walls
- **Mirror:** Shows him that the armour was a choice, not a requirement
- **Bridge:** Can explain Tunde to Rachel in ways that help

### Visual Notes
```
Yoruba features, French style
Warm but direct - doesn't do bullshit
Carries herself with confidence
Has history with Tunde in her eyes
```

---

## Family System Dynamics

### The Triangle

```
           TUNDE
          /      \
    (withdrawal)  (friction)
        /          \
    RACHEL ------- MAYA
        \          /
    (worry) (monitoring)
        \          /
           TAYO
```

**When Tunde withdraws:** Rachel over-invests in Maya (emotional proxy)
**When Rachel-Maya conflict:** Tunde pulled in as judge/ally
**Throughout:** Tayo works to keep all relationships "okay"

### What Each Person Doesn't Say

| Character | The Unsaid |
|-----------|------------|
| Tunde | "I was scared at boarding school and I've never stopped being scared" |
| Rachel | "I'm lonely in this marriage and I don't know if you really see me" |
| Maya | "I wish I was just one thing. I'm tired of explaining myself." |
| Tayo | "I don't know why I feel like it's my job to make everyone okay" |

## The Fashanu Home

**Location:** Suburbs, UK
**Class:** Working class doing okay

### Rooms as Emotional Spaces

**Living Room:**
- Grey sofa, family photos on wall
- Tunde's armchair (his controlled space)
- Where family performs "okay" for each other

**Kitchen:**
- Rachel's domain
- Where real conversations almost happen
- Kids' drawings on fridge (evidence of a time before the tension)

**Maya's Bedroom:**
- Door often closed
- Art supplies everywhere
- Her sanctuary - where she's fully herself

**Tayo's Bedroom:**
- Books, football things
- Less private - he doesn't protect his space like Maya
- Often comes out to check on people

---

## Themes (Research-Grounded)

1. **Boarding school syndrome** - How early separation creates adults who can't do intimacy
2. **The partner's loneliness** - What it costs to love someone who can't fully let you in
3. **Mixed-race identity work** - Building a self that nobody handed you
4. **Parentification** - When children become emotional caretakers
5. **Family triangles** - How tension moves between people
6. **The unsaid** - What we protect ourselves from saying, and what it costs
7. **Nigerian diaspora pressure** - Success as debt repayment, discipline clashes, cultural continuity anxiety

---

## Episode Design Principle

Each 60-90 second episode:

| Segment | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| 0-15 sec | Surface tension (the "what") |
| 15-45 sec | Complication revealing deeper truth (the "why") |
| 45-70 sec | Moment of recognition - character glimpses their pattern |
| 70-90 sec | Resonance, not resolution |

**Rule:** Never fully resolve. Real families don't resolve in 90 seconds. They understand a little more, then live with it.
