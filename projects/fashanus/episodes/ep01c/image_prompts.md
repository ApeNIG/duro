# Episode 1C: The Confrontation - Image Prompts

## Scene 1: The Freeze
**Filename:** `scene1_freeze.png`

```
Warm-lit living room, evening. African-British family home, suburban UK.
11-year-old mixed-race girl (light brown skin, shoulder-length curly natural hair,
casual home clothes - leggings and hoodie) frozen in doorway, body tense.

35-year-old Nigerian man (dark brown skin, strong jaw, short neat beard,
kind but guarded eyes, wearing casual polo shirt) sitting on grey sofa,
holding a sketchbook open in his hands. His posture is composed, controlled.
Expression unreadable - not angry, but closed.

The distance between them dominates the frame.
Warm home lighting from lamps, family photos on wall slightly visible.
Grey sofa, wooden floor, lived-in but tidy.

Mood: Tension before storm. The silence is loud.
Style: Photorealistic, cinematic film still, 16:9 aspect ratio.
Camera: Medium-wide shot, slight low angle to emphasize the standoff.

## Scene 2: The Clash
**Filename:** `scene2_clash.png`

```
Same living room. Father and daughter in confrontation - standing now, facing each other.
Spatial distance between them feels like a chasm.

Nigerian father (35, dark skin, short beard, polo shirt) - body language closed,
arms may be crossed or at sides but tense. Face showing controlled frustration.
Mixed-race daughter (11, light brown skin, curly hair) - body language defensive,
chin slightly raised, eyes hurt beneath the defiance.

In the doorway behind: White British mother (37, fair skin, light freckles,
shoulder-length light brown hair, wearing cardigan) - face showing concern
and a flicker of something sadder. Helpless. Wanting to bridge the gap.

Barely visible behind her: 8-year-old mixed-race boy, small face watching.
Just the edge of him - he's always watching.

Warm domestic setting (grey sofa, family photos, lamps) contrasts with
the emotional coldness between father and daughter.

Mood: The fight is happening but it's not about what they're saying.
Style: Photorealistic, domestic drama, cinematic composition.
Camera: Two-shot favoring the space between them. Depth of field includes doorway.

## Scene 3: The Break
**Filename:** `scene3_break.png`

```
Intimate close-up: 11-year-old mixed-race girl's face.
Light brown skin, expressive eyes that have Dad's shape, curly natural hair.

Expression: The armor cracking. Not crying yet, but tears forming.
This is the moment between anger and raw hurt.
The question "Why isn't it enough?" lives in her eyes.

Background very soft/blurred - warm lamp light, suggestion of father's figure
out of focus. She's in sharp focus. This is her moment.

Warm golden-hour style lighting catches the moisture in her eyes.
One tear might be about to fall. Or not. The tension of almost.

Mood: The real question finally asked. Devastating vulnerability.
Style: Photorealistic, intimate portrait, emotionally raw.
Camera: Extreme close-up, shallow depth of field. Her face fills the frame.

## Scene 4: The Monitor
**Filename:** `scene4_monitor.png`

```
Hallway of family home, shot from low angle (child's eye level).
8-year-old mixed-race boy (light brown skin, short curly hair,
cheeky face that's not cheeky right now, casual home clothes).

He stands alone in the middle of the hallway, small figure in the frame.
His right hand pressed against his stomach - unconscious gesture.
Posture uncertain, weight shifting. Doesn't know where to go.

Behind him: Maya's bedroom door, closed. Warm light under the crack.
In the other direction (visible): Edge of living room where parents are.
Silent. The kind of silence that's worse than shouting.

The hallway feels longer than it is. He feels smaller than he is.
Warm home lighting but he looks cold, overwhelmed.
Family photos on the wall - happier times watching over him.

Mood: An 8-year-old who thinks this is his job. Quiet devastation.
Style: Photorealistic, poignant, child's perspective.
Camera: Low angle, wide enough to show his smallness in the space.
