# Episode 1C: The Confrontation

## Overview
**Perspective:** Maya (with Tayo's parentification visible)
**Logline:** Tunde confronts Maya about the sketchbook. What looks like anger is fear wearing armor.

**Research threads active:**
- Tunde: Boarding school syndrome - control as protection, "sending away" trigger
- Rachel: Emotional labor - translating, filling gaps, resentment leaking
- Maya: Identity wound - "Art is me. Rejecting my art is rejecting who I am."
- Tayo: Parentification - monitoring, trying to defuse, stomach ache

---

## Scene 1: The Freeze (0:00-0:15)
**Location:** Living room
**Characters:** Maya enters, Tunde holding sketchbook

**[Maya walks in. Stops. Sees her sketchbook in Tunde's hands.]**

**[His face is unreadable. Controlled. The strategic self.]**

**TUNDE:**
"Sit down, Maya."

**[She doesn't move. Her sanctuary has been breached.]**

**[Wide shot: the distance between them. A battlefield.]**

---

## Scene 2: The Clash (0:15-0:40)
**Location:** Living room
**Characters:** Tunde, Maya. Rachel appears in doorway. Tayo hovers behind her.

**TUNDE:**
"An art competition. You've been lying to me for two weeks."

**MAYA:**
"I knew you'd say no."

**TUNDE:**
"So you went behind my back."

**MAYA:**
"Because you don't listen! You never—"

**TUNDE:**
*(voice dropping, not rising - the quieter he gets, the more he's feeling)*
"I'm trying to protect you. Art competitions don't become careers. They become regrets."

**[Rachel steps forward, filling the gap like she always does]**

**RACHEL:**
"Tunde, maybe we could just look at her work before—"

**TUNDE:**
"Rachel. Please."

**[He says it without looking at her. She stops. The loneliness flickers across her face.]**

**[Tayo, in the doorway, takes a small step forward. Nobody notices.]**

---

## Scene 3: The Break (0:40-0:55)
**Location:** Living room
**Characters:** Maya, breaking open

**MAYA:**
"You never support anything I actually care about."

**TUNDE:**
"That's not—"

**MAYA:**
*(the real wound)*
"What's wrong with who I am, Dad? Why isn't it enough?"

**[Tunde freezes. This isn't about art anymore and he knows it.]**

**[He opens his mouth. Nothing comes out. The words he's never said stay unsaid.]**

**MAYA:**
"Forget it."

**[She runs. Door slams.]**

**[Tunde stands alone. Rachel looks at him - wanting to reach him, not knowing how.]**

**[She leaves too. Another direction. The gap widens.]**

---

## Scene 4: The Monitor (0:55-1:10)
**Location:** Hallway
**Characters:** Tayo alone

**[Tayo stands in the hallway. Maya's door: closed. Parents in living room: silent.]**

**[He looks one way. Then the other. His hands fidget.]**

**[He doesn't know where to go. But he knows he should do something.]**

**[He walks to the kitchen. Puts the kettle on. For no one in particular.]**

**[His stomach hurts. He presses his hand against it.]**

**[Close-up: An 8-year-old who thinks this is his job.]**

## End Card

## Director's Notes

### What This Episode Is Really About
This isn't a fight about an art competition. It's about:
- A father whose fear of his daughter suffering looks like control
- A daughter whose art is her identity, so rejection of art = rejection of self
- A mother who fills every silence but is never heard herself
- A son who has learned that family peace is his responsibility

### Performance Notes

**Tunde:** Gets QUIETER when emotional, not louder. The control is the tell. When Maya asks "What's wrong with who I am?" - he freezes because he has no answer that doesn't require him to talk about boarding school.

**Maya:** Her final question is the real one. Everything before it is armor. "Why isn't it enough?" is what she's been asking her whole life.

**Rachel:** She's not weak. She's exhausted. Her stepping forward is love. His "Rachel. Please." lands like a door closing. The flicker of loneliness must be visible.

**Tayo:** No dialogue. His actions say everything. The kettle. The stomach. The not-knowing-where-to-go. He's 8 and he's trying to hold the family together.

### The Episode's Emotional Arc
```
Control → Clash → Crack → Collapse → Aftermath
(Tunde)   (Both)   (Maya)  (Everyone)  (Tayo alone)
```

### What Viewers Should Feel
"I've seen this fight. I've been in this fight. I didn't know what was underneath it until now."
