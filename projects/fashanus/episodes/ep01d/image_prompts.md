# Episode 1D: The Father - Image Prompts

## Scene 1: The Aftermath
**Filename:** `scene1_aftermath.png`

```
Living room, evening. Same setting as Episode 1C but emptier now.
35-year-old Nigerian man (dark brown skin, strong jaw, short neat beard,
polo shirt) stands alone in the middle of the room.

His posture has shifted - shoulders slightly dropped, the control slipping.
He holds a sketchbook open in his hands, looking down at the drawings.
Expression: not anger. Something rawer underneath. Grief. Recognition.
The moment when the armor cracks.

The room feels too large around him. Grey sofa, family photos on wall,
warm lamp lighting - but he looks isolated despite the warmth.

Mood: The silence after everyone left. A man alone with the truth.
Style: Photorealistic, cinematic, intimate character study.
Camera: Medium shot, slight distance to emphasize his isolation.

## Scene 2: The Memory
**Filename:** `scene2_memory.png`

```
Dreamlike memory image. Slightly desaturated, edges soft, ethereal quality.

Central image: Hands of a young Black boy (age 12) drawing on paper.
Architectural sketches visible - buildings reaching upward, bridges, structures.
Hope and ambition visible in the confident lines.
Edge of boarding school uniform visible - white shirt collar, dark tie.

Overlaid/ghosted: Present-day Tunde's face in profile, eyes closed,
remembering. The adult and child connected across time.

The drawings are detailed, skilled for a child. This was talent.
This was a dream.

Mood: Memory quality - something precious that was put away.
Style: Photorealistic but dreamlike. Soft focus, desaturated,
time collapsed. The past alive in the present.
Camera: Composite image - close-up on hands/drawings with face overlay.
```

## Scene 3: The Fear
**Filename:** `scene3_fear.png`

```
Living room. Tunde seated on grey sofa, slumped slightly forward.
The sketchbook rests on the cushion beside him.
His hands clasped between his knees, head slightly bowed.
Something has shifted in his body language - the control loosened.

In the doorway behind: Rachel (37, white British, fair skin, light freckles,
light brown hair, cardigan) stands watching. Not entering.
Her body leans slightly forward - wanting to reach him.
Her expression: concern, tenderness, confusion. She sees something new.

The distance between them is visible - she's at the threshold,
he's in the middle of the room, not looking at her.
But the distance feels different than before. Possible.

Warm evening lamplight. The home feels quiet.

Mood: A crack in the wall. The closest to vulnerable he's ever been.
Style: Photorealistic, domestic intimacy, the weight of unsaid things.
Camera: Wide enough to show the distance, intimate enough to see expressions.
```

## Scene 4: The Door
**Filename:** `scene4_door.png`

```
Hallway of family home. Maya's bedroom door - white/light colored, closed.
Warm light visible in the crack underneath - she's inside.

Tunde stands before the door, seen from behind and slightly to the side.
His profile partially visible. One hand raised, about to knock.
The sketchbook (Maya's) held in his other hand.

His posture: hesitant but resolved. The moment before action.
Not defeated, not aggressive. Something new. Vulnerability.

The hallway stretches behind him - the family home, the distance traveled.
Family photos on the wall witness this moment.

Mood: Possibility. The moment before potential change.
Style: Photorealistic, quietly hopeful, cinematic.
Camera: Behind/side angle. Focus on his hand and the door.
The knock that hasn't happened yet.
```

## Scene 2 Alternative: Young Tunde
**Filename:** `scene2_young_tunde.png`

*If the composite memory image is too complex:*

```
Simple, powerful image: A young Black boy, age 8.
Standing alone at iron gates - suggesting boarding school entrance.
Small suitcase beside him. Uniform too big for him.
Looking back over his shoulder.

Expression: Trying to be brave. Not succeeding.
The moment of being left.

Style: Slightly desaturated, memory quality.
Early morning light, mist possible.
The gates and building loom large; he is small.

This is the origin of everything.
```
