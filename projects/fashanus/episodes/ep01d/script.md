# Episode 1D: The Father

## Overview
**Perspective:** Tunde
**Logline:** We finally see inside Tunde. He once had dreams too. He's not angry. He's terrified.

**Research threads active:**
- Boarding school syndrome - the unsaid finally surfaces (internally)
- Abandoned dreams - he gave them up because he had to
- Fear disguised as protection
- The possibility of breaking the pattern

**This is the episode where viewers stop seeing the villain and see the wound.**

## Scene 1: The Aftermath (0:00-0:15)
**Location:** Living room - same moment as 1C ending, different angle
**Characters:** Tunde alone

**[Maya's door slams. The sound echoes.]**

**[Tunde stands frozen. Rachel's footsteps fade the other direction.]**

**[He's alone. The sketchbook still in his hands.]**

**TUNDE (voiceover):**
"She thinks I don't understand."

**[He looks down at her drawings. Really looks.]**

**TUNDE (voiceover):**
"She doesn't know."

**[Close-up: His face. Not angry. Something closer to grief.]**

---

## Scene 2: The Memory (0:15-0:40)
**Location:** Flashback - multiple fragments
**Characters:** Young Tunde (memory), present Tunde (voiceover)

**[Flash: A boy's hands drawing. Age 12. Boarding school uniform visible.]**

**TUNDE (voiceover):**
"I used to draw. All the time."

**[Flash: Architectural sketches. Buildings reaching upward. Hope on paper.]**

**TUNDE (voiceover):**
"I was going to be an architect. Build things. Create things."

**[Flash: The drawings being put away. A trunk closing. Leaving.]**

**TUNDE (voiceover):**
"But where I came from, dreams were a luxury."

**[Flash: Young Tunde's face. 8 years old. Being left at boarding school gates.]**

**TUNDE (voiceover):**
"Survival came first. It had to."

**[Present: Tunde's face. The boy is still in there.]**

---

## Scene 3: The Fear (0:40-0:55)
**Location:** Living room, present
**Characters:** Tunde alone, then Rachel appears

**[Tunde sits. The weight visible.]**

**[Rachel appears in the doorway. Watching him. The gap between them.]**

**RACHEL:**
"Tunde... what happened in there?"

**[Long pause. He doesn't look at her.]**

**TUNDE:**
"I don't want her to wonder."

**RACHEL:**
"Wonder what?"

**[Beat. The closest he's ever come to saying it.]**

**TUNDE:**
"What if she'd tried."

**[Rachel doesn't understand. But she sees something break in him.]**

**[She takes a step toward him. He still doesn't look up.]**

---

## Scene 4: The Door (0:55-1:10)
**Location:** Hallway outside Maya's bedroom
**Characters:** Tunde

**[Tunde walks to Maya's door. Stops.]**

**[He holds her sketchbook. Looks at the drawings again.]**

**TUNDE (voiceover):**
"She's better than I ever was."

**[His hand rises toward the door. Hesitates.]**

**TUNDE (voiceover):**
"Maybe that's what scares me."

**[He takes a breath. The hand steadies.]**

**[Close-up: His knuckles about to knock.]**

**[Hold on the door. The possibility.]**

## End Card
"Some walls take years to build. And one knock to question."

## Image Prompts Needed

### Scene 1: The Aftermath
```
Living room, evening. Same setting as Episode 1C.
35-year-old Nigerian man (dark skin, short beard, polo shirt) stands alone.
His posture has collapsed slightly - the control slipping.
Sketchbook in his hands, looking down at it.
Expression: not anger. Something rawer. Grief. Recognition.
The room feels empty around him.
Warm home lighting but he looks cold, isolated.
Style: Photorealistic, intimate, the moment after everyone left.
```

### Scene 2: The Memory (Flashback)
```
Split/fragmented memory image. Dreamlike quality, slightly desaturated.
Hands of a young Black boy (12) drawing architectural sketches.
Boarding school uniform partially visible - white shirt, tie.
The drawings show buildings, reaching upward. Hope visible in the lines.
Overlay/ghost of present-day Tunde's face, eyes closed, remembering.
Style: Photorealistic but with memory quality - edges soft,
slightly ethereal. The past bleeding into present.
```

### Scene 3: The Fear
```
Living room. Tunde seated on grey sofa, slumped slightly.
The sketchbook beside him. His hands clasped, head slightly bowed.
In the doorway: Rachel (37, white British, cardigan) watching.
Distance between them visible - she's at the threshold, he's closed off.
But there's something different in him - a crack in the armor.
Her expression: concern, wanting to reach him, not knowing how.
Warm lamp light, evening. Intimate domestic moment.
Style: Photorealistic, the weight of what's not being said visible.
```

### Scene 4: The Door
```
Hallway. Tunde stands before Maya's closed bedroom door.
Shot from behind/side - we see his profile, the door, his hand raised.
The sketchbook in his other hand.
Warm light from under Maya's door - she's inside.
His posture: hesitant but resolved. About to knock.
The moment before potential change.
Style: Photorealistic, quietly hopeful. Possibility in the frame.
```

## Director's Notes

### What This Episode Is Really About
This is the turn. The audience has seen Tunde as the obstacle. Now they see him as the wounded. The reveal isn't that he's secretly nice - it's that his control comes from his own pain.

### The Voiceover
This is the first time we're inside Tunde's head. The voiceover should feel:
- Reluctant (he doesn't do this, even internally)
- Simple (he's not poetic, he's direct)
- Heavy (these thoughts have weight because he's never let them exist)

### Performance Notes

**Tunde's voice:**
- Voiceover lines should be quieter than his dialogue
- Not performative - this is internal, private
- The line "She's better than I ever was" is the hardest for him to admit
- "What if she'd tried" is really about him - the crack in his voice matters

**Rachel:**
- She sees something she's never seen - him vulnerable
- Her step toward him is love. His not looking up is the pattern.
- She doesn't understand yet, but she knows something shifted

### The Episode's Emotional Arc
```
Isolation → Memory → Admission → Possibility
(alone)     (past)    (almost saying it)  (the door)
```

### What Viewers Should Feel
"Oh. He's not the villain. He's the boy who never got to try. And he doesn't know how to stop being that boy."

### The Silence
The flashback has no dialogue from young Tunde. Just images and adult voiceover. The child didn't have words for what was happening. The adult still barely does.

## Arc Resolution Note

This episode ends on possibility, not resolution. Tunde stands at the door but we don't see him knock. We don't hear the conversation.

**Why:** Real change is slow. One knock doesn't fix 20 years of patterns. But one knock starts something. The audience should feel hope, not closure.

**Future episodes** can show:
- The conversation (or failed conversation) that follows
- Tunde slowly learning to support differently
- Setbacks (he will revert to control under stress)
- Small victories (one moment of genuine presence)

The thesis holds: *Understanding a little more, then living with it.*
