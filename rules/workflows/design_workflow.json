      "1. Competitor Research - analyze 5-6 competitors, document features/UX patterns",
      "2. Competitive Analysis Board - create Want/Don't Want annotations",
      "3. Define Keywords - choose 4-5 adjectives for visual direction",
      "4. Moodboard - create in Pencil with color, typography, imagery, UI elements",
      "5. Review & Approval - validate direction before mockups",
      "6. Mockups in Pencil - design screens based on approved moodboard",
